<H1><A NAME=SECTION00020000000000000000>2 A Basic Model of Information Retrieval Systems</A></H1>
<P>
Models of information retrieval systems are commonly found in information
retrieval texts and papers (e.g. [<A HREF="node6.html#lancaster79">Lancaster 79</A>, p. 8,]; [<A HREF="node6.html#meadow92">Meadow 92</A>, p.
5,]; [<A HREF="node6.html#soergel85">Soergel 85</A>, p. 58,]; [<A HREF="node6.html#vickery87">Vickery &amp; Vickery 87</A>, p. 11,]; [<A HREF="node6.html#cjvr79">van Rijsbergen 79</A>, p.
7,]).  Such models are generally in the form shown in Figure 1, with
varying amounts of additional descriptive detail depending of the purpose of
the description.

<BR><STRONG>Figure 1:</STRONG> General model of information retrieval systems.<BR>
<P>
<P>
 [<A HREF="node6.html#tague91">Tague <em> et al</em> 91</A>] published a ``complete formal model for information
retrieval systems'' using production grammars and hypergraphs to represent
text structure, indexing, and access.  However this is really a procedural
model of text retrieval techniques.  Descriptions of the operation of
individual retrieval systems are likely to have detailed flow diagrams of that
particular system's components.  Here, however, we are interested in developing
a complete, generalized functional analysis of information selection systems.
<P>
To develop a complete and general model of the functional components of
bibliographic information storage and retrieval systems we proceed by
outlining a descriptive model of information storage and retrieval procedures.
This illustrative model is intended to be minimally complete in that it
includes all the <em> different types</em> of functional components found in all
retrieval systems.  The hope is that the components identified in this basic,
illustrative model could be used to construct a functional representation of
any information storage and retrieval systems of any complexity, including
extended retrieval architectures.  As a check on the adequacy of the analysis
three examples of information storage and retrieval systems will be examined
later.
<P>
<H2><A NAME=SECTION00021000000000000000>2.1 Input</A></H2>
<P>
System boundaries are arbitrary.  Where they are drawn determines which flows
of data are regarded as flowing in to and out of the system in whatever form.
The inputs, queries and records, may be retained or discarded (perhaps by
being relegated to other storage).  There can also be feedback concerning any
process.
<P>

<P>
<UL><LI> One kind of input supplies the stored and potentially retrievable
	data: documents, bibliographic records, images, etc., and/or
	representations of them.
    <LI> Queries constitute another kind of input in one of several forms:
	free-text, boolean keywords, formal query language statements, etc.
    <LI> External knowledge may also be drawn upon in the form of controlled
	vocabularies, syndetic structures, subject headings, descriptions,
	etc. 
</UL>
<P>
There can be multiple outputs.  The most obvious output is the expression of
the retrieval results, in whatever form.  More generally there can be feedback
reporting the effects of any procedure.
<P>
With this in mind, we now outline the functional components that appear to be
necessary and sufficient to represent information storage and retrieval
systems.  Not all components are present in all systems.  Some components
could be present more than once.  Components may be implemented in more than
one way, i.e. using different techniques.  Note also that, as is usually the
case in systems analysis, the granularity of the components is somewhat
arbitrary.  We propose that the following components, displayed in summary in
Figure <A HREF="node2.html#bibmodel">2</A>, are necessary and sufficient, between them, to
represent the functionality of all operational information storage and
retrieval systems.  The intention is that the analysis will be technologically
independent, one that would be as valid for paper-based as for computer-based
retrieval systems.

<P>
<H3><A NAME=SECTION00022100000000000000> User Query</A></H3>
<P>
One form of input from the environment is the User's query, an expression of
the user's information need, more or less compromised by the user's
expectation of and experience with the information retrieval system.  The
``user'' is ordinarily thought of as a human being, but the query could well
be generated by a machine and only indirectly by a human being, such as in the
case of relevance feedback or multi-stage retrieval.
<P>
<H3><A NAME=SECTION00022200000000000000> Source Objects</A></H3>
<P>
A set of Source Objects of interest: documents, records, artifacts, images,
signals, etc.  These arise in the environment outside of the information
selection system.  A general theory of information storage and retrieval
should be able to include bibliographic systems (searching records
representing documents), ``full-text'' searching, copies or representations of
museum artifacts, and, indeed, of any kind of definable phenomena, including
imaginary ones.  The set of source objects may well be a carefully selected
set, as in a library or museum collection.
<P>
These objects and/or copies and/or transformations of them become ``resource
input'' to the retrieval system.  Through a variety of possible processes,
they become the Representations in the system.
<P>
<H3><A NAME=SECTION00022300000000000000> External Knowledge Sources</A></H3>
<P>
External Knowledge Sources are used in information selection Representation
Making, Index Making and Query Development.  In Representation Making, the
external knowledge may be in the form of what people know or has been recorded
concerning the Source Objects, their contexts (e.g. domain knowledge), their
possible representations (e.g. linguistic knowledge, thesauri, etc.), or their
internal structures and interrelationships, are another resource which can be
drawn on as a supplement to or as a substitute for the source objects.
<P>
Such knowledge can also be used in Query Development and Index Making in the
form of thesauri, controlled vocabularies, subject heading lists,
classification schemes, syndetic structures (use, see also, etc.),
dictionaries, search intermediaries, etc.  One of the major research areas in
this field is to see how far this external knowledge can be formalized and
moved <em> inside</em> the system and used in this way.
<P>
In an ideal world these three processes (Representation Making, Index Making,
and Query Development) would all draw on the same, identical knowledge sources,
but this is unlikely in practice.  With the rise of client/server
architectures, we can expect separation of the Query Knowledge Sources from
the Representation Knowledge Sources and the Searchable Index Knowledge
Sources.  Knowledge Sources need to be continuously revised and updated and
there is no assurance that the updating will be identical and synchronized.
Further, the use of an External Knowledge Source in creating Representations
is chronologically prior to the use of the External Knowledge Source for Query
Development and may be several years prior, creating possible vocabulary
problems even if the same External Knowledge Sources were used.
<P>
<H2><A NAME=SECTION00023000000000000000>2.3 Internal Components</A></H2>
<P>
<H3><A NAME=SECTION00023100000000000000> Representations</A></H3>
<P>
Representations of the source objects are composed from the resource inputs in
some combination of a copy or transformation according to the Representation
Making Rules of part (or all) of the Source Objects and/or any (external)
representations or descriptions (from External Knowledge Sources) of those
resource objects.  Representations can be derived from:
<P>
<OL><LI> Source Objects
    <UL><LI> Part or all of the object itself, possibly copied and/or
	transformed.  For textual objects these could include the text, title,
	original abstract, etc.  For images, these could be scanned copies.
	(These are the ``brute facts'' of [<A HREF="node6.html#blair90">Blair 90</A>].)
<P>
    <LI> Descriptive features implicitly in or algorithmically derivable from
	the object: e.g. word occurrence, frequency, and co-occurrence;
	automatic abstractions from (or patterns recognized in) images; etc.
    </UL>
<P>
    <LI> External Knowledge Sources
    <UL><LI> Features derivable from other objects inside (e.g. relative word
	frequency in relation to a corpus) or outside (e.g. synonyms of
	topical terms) the retrieval system that are related to this object.
<P>
    <LI> Description or documentation of the object: description of the
	physical object and/or statements about the origins of the object
	and/or what the object signifies, e.g. subject headings, subject
	classification.
    </UL></OL>
<P>
Depending on the nature and extent of the Representation Making Rules, the
Representations, then, might be a more or less transformed copies of the Source
Objects: in a collection of unedited full-texts, each text (or copy of it)
would constitute its own Representation.  It might be a more of less
transformed description of the object: in museum registration the
representation might include an image of the object, but none of the original
object itself (unless, presumably, it is a museum of electronic objects).  In
other cases the representation could be derived in part from the source object
and in part from a description: in bibliographic systems, such as a library
catalog, fragments derived from the object (e.g. title, publisher's name)
would be combined with pieces of description (e.g. subject headings).
<P>
<H3><A NAME=SECTION00023200000000000000> Searchable Index</A></H3>
<P>
Since the Representation is what is stored, the Representation is also that
which could, in principle, be searched and, following selection, produced as
output for display or other purposes.  But this is not necessarily supported
in practice.  Current online library catalogs, for example, typically restrict
searching to a few fields (notably author, title, and subject headings) within
Representations that contain several other fields in which searching is not
supported.  This is sufficient reason why it is necessary to make a
distinction between the Representation and the <em> Searchable Index</em>.  The
Searchable Index, in this technical sense, is the searchable part of the
Representation.  We use ``Searchable Index Rules'' to denote whatever
determines what is to be searchable.  Retrieval systems commonly have in
addition, a syndetic structure for mapping permissible searches (see, see
also, stop words, etc.), which we also treat as a second component of the
Searchable Index.  Again, in the case of unedited full-text, the Searchable
Index will be co-extensive with the Representation and, therefore, with the
Source Object (the original text).  But, as noted, in other cases, such as
library catalogs, the Index Making Rules can restrict which parts of the
Representation are available in the Searchable Index.  The Searchable Index
(like the Representation and the Source Object) might be partitioned into
separate (sub)indexes, to allow more precise, targeted searching.
<P>
Procedurally, the Index Making process can be implemented in different ways:
the Searchable Index might be derived by literally making parts of the
Representations available for searching; it might be derived by copying parts
of Representations; it may even be that part or all of the Representations
exist physically only as fragments distributed via the Index Making Rules to
the Searchable Index to be reassembled if and when needed.  But we regard
these alternatives as functionally equivalent and are not interested here in
the technical details of implementation (storage costs, search effort, delay,
etc.) that will make one technique preferable to another.
<P>
<H3><A NAME=SECTION00023300000000000000> Query Development Rules and Formal Queries</A></H3>
<P>
Query development is a function that mediates between the User Query and the
Formal Query.  It transforms the user's query in order to harmonize it with
the system's vocabulary of retrieval commands, index specification, and index
vocabulary prior to retrieval.  This role has traditionally been seen as an
important function for skilled human intermediaries.
<P>
Computer-based query development that can match queries with the vocabulary in
(or expected to be in) the system's Searchable Index is commonly called an
``entry vocabulary'' module.  Examples include CITE [<A HREF="node6.html#doszkocs83">Doszkocs 83</A>],
PaperChase [<A HREF="node6.html#horowitz83">Horowitz <em> et al</em> 83</A>], and Grateful Med [<A HREF="node6.html#cahan89">Cahan 89</A>].  Automation of
this function is promising and offers scope for expert and probabilistic
techniques.  ``Entry vocabulary'' modules parallel the syndetic structure,
thesaurus and controlled vocabulary aspects of External Knowledge Sources used
to create the Representation.  It might ideally draw on the <em> same</em>
thesaurus or other knowledge representation scheme, but it cannot be assumed
that the same external sources will be used for these different components.
<P>
A query development system may be absent, present, or multiply present in any
given retrieval system.  (We will discuss query development in more detail
below).
<P>
The Formal Query is the query as it is seen by the Matching Rule, after it has
been transformed by the Query Development Rules.  Examples of such formal
transformations include truncation, weighting, substitution, normalization,
vectorization, etc., many of which are conversions of ``external''
representations to ``internal'' representations.  Such transformations apply
both to computer and human based retrieval systems.
<P>
<H3><A NAME=SECTION00023400000000000000> Retrieved Sets</A></H3>
<P>
A Retrieved set is logically a subset of the Representations as partitioned
off by the outcome of the Matching Rule applied to the Formal Query and the
Searchable Index.  When displayed (or delivered as output) the retrieved set
may be complete copies or very incomplete, transformed versions of members of
the set of Representations.  Note that this is not necessarily a simple binary
outcome: Retrieve and Not Retrieved.
<P>
<H3><A NAME=SECTION00023500000000000000> Sorting Rules</A></H3>
<P>
Commonly, but not necessarily, there is a separate process of sorting the
retrieved set.  Online library catalogs typically reorder retrieved sets
alphabetically by author (strictly, by ``main entry'') prior to display.  In
card catalogs the order of the retrieved set is predetermined by the order in
which the cards were filed.  With retrieval systems that generate a strict
rank-ordering, the ranked order preempts any postretrieval reordering.  For a
more detailed discussion see [<A HREF="node6.html#oasis93b">Buckland <em> et al</em> 93</A>].
<P>
<H2><A NAME=SECTION00024000000000000000>2.4 Output Streams</A></H2>
<P>
Retrieval output, traditionally in the form of a display, but increasingly in
the form of a stream of objects to be used elsewhere or for some other
purpose, completes the basic retrieval cycle.  Such streams can be directed to
visualization tools, storage for later processing, or use as Input Streams to
other selection systems, or as feedback within the system itself.
<P>
<H2><A NAME=SECTION00025000000000000000>2.5 Feedback</A></H2>
<P>
There is, in principle, an opportunity for feedback from the output of any
process.  For example, the output from any process can constitute feedback to
other processes and to the searcher.  Feedback can provide the basis for
expert judgment or expert systems at any stage.  Since feedback is a property
of all systems and is not specific to retrieval systems we note it here, but
do not explore it further in this paper.
