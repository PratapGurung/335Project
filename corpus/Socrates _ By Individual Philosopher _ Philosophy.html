<P><B>Socrates</B> (c. 469 - 399 <FONT SIZE="2">B.C.</FONT>) was a hugely important <B>Greek</B> philosopher from the <A HREF="historical_socratic.html">Classical</A> period (often known as the <A HREF="historical_socratic.html">Socratic</A> period in his honor). Unlike most of the <A HREF="historical_presocratic.html">Pre-Socratic philosophers</A> who came before him, who were much more interested in establishing <B>how the world works</B>, Socrates was more concerned with <B>how people should behave</B>, and so was perhaps the first major philosopher of <A HREF="branch_ethics.html">Ethics</A>.</P>
<P>An <B>enigmatic figure</B> known to us only through other people's accounts (principally the <B>dialogues</B> of his student <A HREF="philosophers_plato.html">Plato</A>), he is credited as one of the <B>founders</B> of <A HREF="general_western.html">Western Philosophy</A>. He is considered by some as the very <B>antithesis</B> of the <A HREF="movements_sophism.html">Sophists</A> of his day, who claimed to have <B>knowledge</B> which they could transmit to others (often for payment), arguing instead that knowledge should be pursued <B>for its own sake</B>, even if one could never fully <B>possess</B> it.</P>
<P>He made important and lasting contributions in the fields of <A HREF="branch_ethics.html">Ethics</A>, <A HREF="branch_epistemology.html">Epistemology</A> and <A HREF="branch_logic.html">Logic</A>, and particularly in the <B>methodology</B> of philosophy (his <B>Socratic Method</B> or <B>"elenchus"</B>). His views were <B>instrumental</B> in the development of many of the major philosophical movements and schools which came after him, including <A HREF="movements_platonism.html">Platonism</A> (and the <A HREF="movements_neoplatonism.html">Neo-Platonism</A> and <A HREF="movements_aristotelianism.html">Aristotelianism</A> it gave rise to), <A HREF="movements_cynicism.html">Cynicism</A>, <A HREF="movements_stoicism.html">Stoicism</A> and <A HREF="movements_hedonism.html">Hedonism</A>.</P>

<P>Socrates was <B>born</B>, as far as we know, in <B>Athens</B> around 469 <FONT SIZE="2">B.C.</FONT> Our knowledge of his life is <B>sketchy</B> and derives mainly from three contemporary sources, the <B>dialogues</B> of <A HREF="philosophers_plato.html">Plato</A> and <B>Xenophon</B> (c. 431 - 355 <FONT SIZE="2">B.C.</FONT>), and the <B>plays</B> of <B>Aristophanes</B> (c. 456 - 386 <FONT SIZE="2">B.C.</FONT>). According to <A HREF="philosophers_plato.html">Plato</A>, Socrates' father was <B>Sophroniscus</B> (a sculptor and stonemason) and his mother was <B>Phaenarete</B> (a midwife). His family was <B>respectable</B> in descent, but <B>humble</B> in means. He appears to have had no more than an <B>ordinary Greek education</B> (reading, writing, gymnastics and music, and, later, geometry and astronomy) before devoting his time almost completely to <B>intellectual interests</B>.</P>
<P>He is usually described as <B>unattractive</B> in appearance and <B>short</B> in stature, and he apparently rarely washed or changed his clothes. But he did nevertheless marry <B>Xanthippe</B>, a woman much <B>younger</B> than he and renowned for her <B>shrewishness</B> (Socrates justified his marriage on the grounds that a horse-trainer needs to hone his skills on the most spirited animals). She bore for him three sons, <B>Lamprocles</B>, <B>Sophroniscus</B> and <B>Menexenus</B>, who were all were quite young children at the time of their father's trial and death and, according to <A HREF="philosophers_aristotle.html">Aristotle</A>, they turned out <B>unremarkable</B>, silly and dull.</P>
<P>It is not known for sure who his <B>teachers</B> were, but he seems to have been acquainted with the doctrines of <A HREF="philosophers_parmenides.html">Parmenides</A>, <A HREF="philosophers_heraclitus.html">Heraclitus</A> and <A HREF="philosophers_anaxagoras.html">Anaxagoras</A>. <A HREF="philosophers_plato.html">Plato</A> recorded the fact that Socrates met <A HREF="philosophers_zeno_elea.html">Zeno of Elea</A> and <A HREF="philosophers_parmenides.html">Parmenides</A> on their trip to Athens, probably in about 450 <FONT SIZE="2">B.C.</FONT> Other influences which have been mentioned include a rhetorician named <B>Prodicus</B>, a student of <A HREF="philosophers_anaxagoras.html">Anaxagoras</A> called <B>Archelaus</B>, and two women (besides his mother): <B>Diotima</B> (a witch and priestess from Mantinea who taught him all about <B>"eros"</B> or love), and <B>Aspasia</B> (the mistress of the Greek statesman <B>Pericles</B>, who taught him the art of <B>funeral orations</B>).</P>
<P>It is not clear how Socrates earned a living. Some sources suggest that he continued the profession of <B>stonemasonry</B> from his father. He apparently served for a time as a <B>member of the senate</B> of Athens, and he served (and reportedly distinguished himself) in the <B>Athenian army</B> during three campaigns at <B>Potidaea</B>, <B>Amphipolis</B> and <B>Delium</B>. However, most texts seem to indicate that Socrates <B>did not work</B>, devoting himself solely to discussing philosophy in the squares of <B>Athens</B>. Using a method now known as the <B>Socratic Method</B> (or <B>Socratic dialogue</B> or <B>dialectic</B>), he grew famous for drawing forth knowledge from his students by pursuing a <B>series of questions</B> and examining the <B>implications of their answers</B>. Often he would <B>question</B> people's unwarranted confidence in the truth of popular opinions, but usually <B>without</B> offering them any clear <B>alternative</B> teaching. Aristophanes portrayed Socrates as running a <A HREF="movements_sophism.html">Sophist</A> school and accepting <B>payment</B> for <B>teaching</B>, but other sources explicitly <B>deny</B> this.</P>
<P>The best known part of Socrates' life is his <B>trial</B> and <B>execution</B>. Despite claiming complete <B>loyalty</B> to his city, Socrates' pursuit of <B>virtue</B> and his strict adherence to <B>truth</B> clashed with the course of <B>Athenian politics</B> and society (particularly in the aftermath of Athens' embarrassing defeats in the <B>Peloponnesian War</B> with Sparta). Socrates raised questions about <B>Athenian religion</B>, but also about <B>Athenian democracy</B> and, in particular, he <B>praised</B> Athens' arch-rival <B>Sparta</B>, causing some scholars to interpret his trial as an expression of <B>political infighting</B>. However, it more likely resulted from his self-appointed position as Athens' <B>social and moral critic</B>, and his insistence on trying to improve the Athenians' <B>sense of justice</B> (rather than upholding the status quo and accepting the development of <B>immorality</B>). His <B>"crime"</B> was probably merely that his <B>paradoxical wisdom</B> made several prominent Athenians look <B>foolish</B> in public.</P>
<P>Whatever the motivation, he was <B>found guilty</B> (by a narrow margin of 30 votes out of the 501 jurors) of <B>impiety</B> and <B>corrupting the minds</B> of the youth of Athens, and he was <B>sentenced to death</B> by drinking a mixture containing <B>poison hemlock</B> in 399 <FONT SIZE="2">B.C.</FONT>, at the age of 70. Although he apparently had an <B>opportunity to escape</B>, he chose not to, believing that a true philosopher should have <B>no fear of death</B>, that it would be against his <B>principles</B> to break his <B>social contract</B> with the state by evading its justice, and that he would probably <B>fare no better</B> elsewhere even if he were to escape into exile.</P>

<P>As has been mentioned, Socrates himself <B>did not write</B> any philosophical texts, and our knowledge of the man and his philosophy is based on writings by his <B>students</B> and <B>contemporaries</B>, particularly <A HREF="philosophers_plato.html">Plato</A>'s dialogues, but also the writings of <A HREF="philosophers_aristotle.html">Aristotle</A>, <B>Xenophon</B> and <B>Aristophanes</B>. As these are either the <B>partisan</B> philosophical texts of his supporters, or works of <B>dramatic</B> rather than historically accurate intent, it is difficult to find the <B>“real”</B> Socrates (often referred to as the <B>"Socratic problem"</B>). In <A HREF="philosophers_plato.html">Plato</A>'s Socratic Dialogues in particular, it is well nigh <B>impossible</B> to tell which of the views <B>attributed</B> to Socrates are actually his and which <A HREF="philosophers_plato.html">Plato</A>'s own.</P>
<P>Perhaps Socrates' <B>most important</B> and <B>enduring</B> single contribution to Western thought is his <B>dialectical</B> method of inquiry, which he referred to as <B>"elenchus"</B> (roughly, "cross-examination") but which has become known as the <B>Socratic Method</B> or <B>Socratic Debate</B> (although some commentators have argued that <A HREF="philosophers_protagoras.html">Protagoras</A> actually invented the “Socratic” method). It has been called a <B>negative method</B> of <B>hypothesis elimination</B>, in that better hypotheses are found by steadily identifying and <B>eliminating</B> those which lead to <B>contradictions</B>. Even today, the <B>Socratic Method</B> is still used in classrooms and law schools as a way of discussing <B>complex topics</B> in order to expose the <B>underlying issues</B> in both the subject and the speaker. Its influence is perhaps most strongly felt today in the use of the <B>Scientific Method</B>, in which the <B>hypothesis</B> is just the first stage towards a proof.</P>
<P>At its simplest, the Socratic Method is used to solve a problem by breaking the problem down into a <B>series of questions</B>, the answers to which <B>gradually distill</B> better and better solutions. Both the questioner and the questioned explore the <B>implications</B> of the other's positions, in order to <B>stimulate rational thinking</B> and <B>illuminate ideas</B>. Thus, Socrates would counter any assertion with a <B>counterexample</B> which disproves the assertion (or at least shows it to be inadequate). This would lead to a <B>modified assertion</B>, which Socrates would then test again with another counterexample. Through several iterations of this kind, the original assertion is continually adjusted and becomes more and more <B>difficult to refute</B>, which Socrates held meant that it was closer and closer to the <B>truth</B>.</P>
<P>Socrates believed fervently in the <B>immortality of the soul</B>, and he was convinced that the gods had singled him out as a kind of <B>divine emissary</B> to persuade the people of Athens that their <B>moral values</B> were wrong-headed, and that, instead of being so concerned with their families, careers, and political responsibilities, they ought to be worried about the <B>"welfare of their souls"</B>. However, he also questioned whether <B>"arete"</B> (or "virtue") can actually be <B>taught</B> as the <A HREF="movements_sophism.html">Sophists</A> believed. He observed that many successful fathers (such as the prominent military general <B>Pericles</B>, for example) did not produce sons of their own quality, which suggested to him that moral excellence was more a matter of <B>divine bequest</B> than parental nurture.</P>
<P>He often claimed that his <B>wisdom</B> was limited to an <B>awareness of his own ignorance</B>, (although he did claim to have knowledge of "<B>the art of love</B>"). Thus, he never actually <B>claimed</B> to be wise, only to <B>understand the path</B> a lover of wisdom must take in pursuing it. His claim that he <B>knew</B> one and only one thing, that he <B>knew nothing</B>, may have influenced the later school of <A HREF="movements_skepticism.html">Skepticism</A>. He saw his role, not as a teacher or a theorist, but as analogous to a <B>midwife</B> who could bring the <B>theories of others</B> to life, although to do so he would of course need to have <B>experience</B> and <B>knowledge</B> of that of which he talked. He believed that <B>anyone</B> could be a philosopher, not just those who were highly trained and educated, and indeed that everyone had a <B>duty</B> to ask philosophical questions (he is famously quoted as claiming that "<B>the unexamined life is not worth living</B>").</P>
<P>Many of the beliefs traditionally attributed to the historical Socrates have been characterized as <B>"paradoxical"</B> because they seem to <B>conflict with common sense</B>, such as: no-one desires evil, no-one errs or does wrong willingly or knowingly; all virtue is knowledge; virtue is sufficient for happiness. He believed that <B>wrongdoing</B> was a consequence of <B>ignorance</B> and those who did wrong <B>knew no better</B> (sometimes referred to as <A HREF="branch_intellectualism.html">Ethical Intellectualism</A>). He believed the best way for people to live was to focus on <B>self-development</B> rather than the pursuit of material wealth, and he always invited others to try to concentrate more on <B>friendships</B> and a sense of <B>true community</B>. He was convinced that humans possessed certain <B>virtues</B> (particularly the important philosophical or intellectual virtues), and that virtue was the most <B>valuable</B> of all possessions, and the ideal life should be spent <B>in search of the Good</B> (an early statement of <A HREF="branch_eudaimonism.html">Eudaimonism</A> or <A HREF="branch_virtue_ethics.html">Virtue Ethics</A>).</P>
<P>Socrates' <B>political views</B>, as represented in <A HREF="philosophers_plato.html">Plato</A>'s dialogue <B><I>"The Republic"</I></B>, were strongly <B>against</B> the <B>democracy</B> that had so recently been restored in the Athens of his day, and indeed against any form of government that did not conform to his <B>ideal</B> of a perfect republic <B>led by philosophers</B>, who he claimed were the only type of person <B>suitable to govern others</B>. He believed that the <B>will of the majority</B> was not necessarily a good method of decision-making, but that it was much more important that decisions be <B>logical and defensible</B>. However, these may be more <A HREF="philosophers_plato.html">Plato</A>'s own views than those of Socrates, <B><I>"The Republic"</I></B> being a "middle period" work often considered to be <B>not representative</B> of the views of the historical Socrates.</P>
<P>In <A HREF="philosophers_plato.html">Plato</A>'s "early" dialogue, <B><I>"Apology of Socrates"</I></B>, Socrates <B>refused</B> to pursue conventional politics, on the grounds that he could not look into the matters of <B>others</B> (or tell people how to live their lives) when he did not yet understand how to live <B>his own</B>. Some have argued that he considered the rule of the <B>"Thirty Tyrants"</B> (who came to power briefly during his life, led by <B>Critias</B>, a relative of <A HREF="philosophers_plato.html">Plato</A> and a one-time <B>student</B> of Socrates himself) even <B>less legitimate</B> than the democratic senate that sentenced him to death.</P>
<P>Likewise, in the dialogues of <A HREF="philosophers_plato.html">Plato</A>, Socrates often appears to support a <B>mystical</B> side, discussing <B>reincarnation</B> and the <B>mystery religions</B> (popular <B>religious cults</B> of the time, such as the <B>Eleusinian Mysteries</B>, restricted to those who had gone through certain secret <B>initiation rites</B>), but how much of this is <B>attributable</B> to Socrates or to Plato himself is not (and never will be) clear. Socrates often referred to what the Greeks called a <B>"daemonic sign"</B>, a kind of <B>inner voice</B> he heard only when he was about to make a <B>mistake</B> (such as the sign that he claimed prevented him from entering into <B>politics</B>). Although we would consider this to be <B>intuition</B> today, Socrates thought of it as a form of <B>"divine madness"</B>, the sort of insanity that is a <B>gift from the gods</B> and gives us <B>poetry</B>, <B>mysticism</B>, <B>love</B> and even <B>philosophy</B> itself.</P>
<P>Socrates' views were <B>instrumental</B> in the development of many of the major philosophical movements and schools which came after him, particularly the <A HREF="movements_platonism.html">Platonism</A> of his principle student <A HREF="philosophers_plato.html">Plato</A>, (and the <A HREF="movements_neoplatonism.html">Neo-Platonism</A> and <A HREF="movements_aristotelianism.html">Aristotelianism</A> it gave rise to). His idea of a life of <B>austerity</B> combined with <B>piety</B> and <B>morality</B> (largely ignored by <A HREF="philosophers_plato.html">Plato</A> and <A HREF="philosophers_aristotle.html">Aristotle</A>) was <B>essential</B> to the core beliefs of later schools like <A HREF="movements_cynicism.html">Cynicism</A> and <A HREF="movements_stoicism.html">Stoicism</A>. Socrates' stature in <A HREF="general_western.html">Western Philosophy</A> returned in full force with the <A HREF="historical_renaissance.html">Renaissance</A> and the <A HREF="historical_reason.html">Age of Reason</A> in Europe when <B>political theory</B> began to resurface under such philosophers as <A HREF="philosophers_locke.html">John Locke</A> and <A HREF="philosophers_hobbes.html">Thomas Hobbes</A>. <B>Aristippus of Cyrene</B> (c. 435 - 360 B.C.), the founder of the school of <A HREF="movements_hedonism.html">Hedonism</A> was also a pupil of Socrates, although he rather <B>skewed</B> Socrates' teaching.</P>
