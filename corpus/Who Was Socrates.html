    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Socrates</b>, 469-399 
      B.C., Greek philosopher of Athens, is generally regarded as one of the wisest 
      people of all time. Socrates himself left no writings, and most of our knowledge 
      of him and his teachings comes from the dialogues of his most famous pupil, 
      <b>Plato</b> (427-347 B.C.), and from the memoirs of Xenophon.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Socrates is described 
      as having neglected his own affairs, instead spending his time discussing 
      virtue, justice, and piety wherever his fellow citizens congregated, seeking 
      wisdom about right conduct so that he might guide the moral and intellectual 
      improvement of Athens. Using a method now known as the Socratic dialogue, 
      or dialectic, he drew forth knowledge from his students by pursuing a series 
      of questions and examining the implications of their answers.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Socrates equated virtue 
      with the knowledge of one's true self, holding that no one knowingly does 
      wrong. He looked upon the soul as the seat of both waking consciousness 
      and moral character, and held the universe to be purposively mind-ordered. 
      His criticism of the Sophists and of Athenian political and religious institutions 
      made him many enemies, and his position was burlesqued by Aristophanes.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> In 399 B.C. Socrates 
      was tried for corrupting the morals of Athenian youth and for religious 
      heresies; it is now believed that his arrest stemmed in particular from 
      his influence on Alcibiades and Critias, who had betrayed Athens. He was 
      convicted and, resisting all efforts to save his life, willingly <a href="death.html" target="blank">drank 
      the cup of poison hemlock</a> given him. The trial and death of Socrates 
      are described by Plato in the <i>Apology,</i> <i>Crito,</i> and <i>Phaedo</i>.</font></p>
