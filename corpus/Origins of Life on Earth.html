<p><b><font color="#FFFFFF"><font size=+2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The origin
of life is one of the great mysteries in the Universe.&nbsp; To determine
the origin of life, scientists are investigating the problem in several
different ways.&nbsp; Some scientists are studying life on our own planet.
Some scientists are seeking out life or fossil life on other planets or
moons in our solar system.&nbsp; And other scientists are trying to detect
life in other solar systems, either by measuring life's effects on the
atmospheres of distant planets or by measuring artificial radiation like
radio signals that may be produced by advanced life.</font></font></b>
<p><b><font color="#FFFFFF"><font size=+2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thus far,
the most fruitful approach has been to examine life on our own planet.&nbsp;
However, even in our own backyard, it is difficult to determine life's
origins because it began at least 3.5 billion years ago.&nbsp; We know
that life began at least 3.5 billion years ago, because that is the age
of the oldest rocks with fossil evidence of life on earth.&nbsp; These
rocks are rare because subsequent geologic processes have reshaped the
surface of our planet, often destroying older rocks while making new ones.&nbsp;
Nonetheless, 3.5 billion year old rocks with fossils can be found in Africa
and Australia.&nbsp; They are usually a mix of solidified volcanic lavas
and sedimentary cherts.&nbsp; The fossils occur in sedimentary cherts.</font></font></b>

<p><b><font color="#FFFFFF"><font size=+2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Chemical traces
of life have also been detected in slightly older rocks.&nbsp; In Greenland,
a series of ancient metamorphosed sediments have been found.&nbsp; Analyses
indicate the sediments were deposited about 3.8 billion years ago.&nbsp;
They also revealed carbon isotope signatures that appear to have been produced
by organisms that lived when the sediments were deposited.</font></font></b>
<p><b><font color="#FFFFFF"><font size=+2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In all cases,
life as we understand it must have water.&nbsp; This general rule is true
on Earth and is thought to be true elsewhere in the solar system.&nbsp;
Currently, life is being sought on Mars where water may have once flowed
on the surface and Europa where a subterranean sea of water may exist beneath
its icy surface.</font></font></b>
<p><b><font color="#FFFFFF"><font size=+2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If one analyzes
the genetic information in a variety of modern organisms living on Earth,
one can begin to group and separate organisms based on their common (or
disparate) properties.&nbsp; This type of analyses is intuitive at some
levels.&nbsp; For example, most people recognize that mule deer and white
tail deer are more closely related than mule deer and grizzly bears.&nbsp;
Consequently, in a tree of life, mule deer would appear closer to white
tail deer than grizzly bears.&nbsp; This same process can be applied to
all organisms and has led to three large domains of life: Bacteria, Archaea,
and Eukarya.&nbsp; Humans, as well as other complex mammals, are part of
the Eukarya group.&nbsp; If one traces the genetic information in organisms
in all three groups, it appears they have a common ancestor or at least
ancestors that share a common set of traits.&nbsp; In either case, it appears
the earlist form of life in the tree of life were thermophilic or hyperthermophilic
organism, which means they lived in systems composed of hot water.</font></font></b>

<p><b><font color="#FFFFFF"><font size=+2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hot water
systems are called hydrothermal systems.&nbsp; These can be found in areas
of volcanic activity where hot molten rock beneath the surface heats groundwater.&nbsp;
Hydrothermal systems produce hot springs and geysers at the surface.&nbsp;
Good examples include Yellowstone on the United States and Rotorua in New
Zealand.</font></font></b>

<p><b><font color="#FFFFFF"><font size=+2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Recently,
Kring and his colleagues have been investigating impact-generated
hydrothermal systems.&nbsp; The energy deposited by an impact event is
so great that it can easily heat water and cause it to circulate through
the Earth's crust.&nbsp; Examples of impact-generated systems have been
found at several impact craters around the world.&nbsp; And although none
of them are active today, they likely produced hot springs and geysers
similar to those produced by magmatic activity beneath the surface of the
Earth.</font></font></b>
<center>
<p><b><font color="#FFFFFF"><font size=+2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Early in Earth's
history, both volcanism and impact cratering were very common processes.&nbsp;
So both may have provided the environments needed to transform disparate
chemical compounds into living organisms and may have provided a suitable
habitat for that life to evolve.</font></font></b>
