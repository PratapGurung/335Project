id="B9780081006764000055-p0080">The information retrieval system is also made up of two components: the indexing system and the query system. The first of these is in charge of analyzing the documents downloaded from the Web and with the creating of indexes that then allow search queries to be made; while the second is the search engine’s visible interface, that is, the part with which users interact.</p><p id="B9780081006764000055-p0085">If a search engine is able to answer questions in such astonishingly short spaces of time as we have become accustomed to (typically, fractions of a second), it is because they do not explore the Web for users in real time (that is, as and when the query is made), but rather they use an index that is updated regularly (several times a day).</p><p id="B9780081006764000055-p0090">A system that attempted to explore the documents on the Web sequentially and in real-time to provide answers would not make the slightest bit of sense. Days or even weeks could pass between the question being asked and an answer being given. Instead of this, what a search engine does is to query its internal indexes.<span id="B9780081006764000055-pg113"></span></p></section></div></div><div class="snippet-ctas u-remove-if-print"><a href="/science/article/pii/B9780081006764000055" target="_blank" role="button" class="view-chapter-button link-button link-button-primary" aria-describedby="tp-snippet-chp-title-B9780081006764000055" data-aa-region="aa-tp-snippet-read-full-chp" data-aa-name="" data-hack="#"><span class="link-button-text">View chapter</span></a><a class="link-button link-button-secondary" role="button" href="https://www.elsevier.com/books/T/A/9780081006764" target="_blank" data-aa-region="aa-tp-purchase-book" data-aa-name=""><span class="link-button-text">Purchase book</span></a></div></article><article class="snippet"><div class="snippet-content"><h2 class="u-font-serif u-text-light" id="tp-snippet-chp-title-B9781876938437500090"><a class="anchor" href="/science/article/pii/B9781876938437500090" data-aa-region="aa-tp-snippet-chp-title" data-aa-name="Information access" data-hack="#"><span class="anchor-text">Information access</span></a></h2><div class="size-l"><cite><p><span>Philip Hider, in </span><a href="/book/9781876938437" class="anchor" data-aa-region="aa-tp-snippet-bk-title" data-aa-name="Libraries in the Twenty-First Century" data-hack="#"><span class="anchor-text">Libraries in the Twenty-First Century</span></a>, 2007</p></cite><section id="B9781876938437500090-s0045"><h3>Indexing</h3><p id="B9781876938437500090-p0110">Most <span class="topic-highlight">information retrieval systems</span>, whether online or manual, are based on some form of indexing. The library catalogue is really a kind of index, albeit often a rather sophisticated one. It refers the user to particular shelf numbers (those numbers used to place and locate books and other physical information resources on the shelves) or to particular files on the world wide web. Similarly, an index at the back of a book refers the reader to page numbers.</p><p id="B9781876938437500090-p0115">Other indexing systems refer not to physically whole items nor to single pages, but to a series of pages that comprise a particular article – they index articles from journals and other forms of serial publication. Nowadays, most of these systems are online, and many constitute very large databases covering hundreds or thousands of serials; many also provide links to online versions of some of the articles they index. Along with the usual types of bibliographic element such as title, author’s name, subject descriptors, many systems include abstracts, or short summaries, of some or all of the articles indexed. Hence these systems are often referred to as indexing and abstracting services. Prominent examples include MEDLINE, LexisNexis, Chemical Abstracts and LISTA (Library, Information Science &amp; Technology Abstracts) – see <span>Chapter 7</span>.</p><p id="B9781876938437500090-p0120">Many libraries and information resource centres provide access to a range of these services as they also house (either physically or virtually) many of the corresponding serials. Conventionally, the databases are not integrated with the library catalogue, but increasingly libraries are offering users a <em>federated search</em> facility. This allows them to search on multiple databases, including the library catalogue, simultaneously. Nevertheless, the bibliographic data <span id="B9781876938437500090-p151"></span>are still stored in separate databases. There are several reasons for this. First, most indexing and abstracting services are commercial concerns – their proprietors need to keep control of the (meta)data. Second, users may wish to limit their search to one particular database with one particular kind of resource. Third, the indexing performed varies across databases, so that different databases use different subject terms, and include different bibliographic elements, according to the nature of material being indexed. Library catalogues are based on standards such as the Anglo-American Cataloguing Rules (see the following section) but these are usually not applied by indexing and abstracting services.</p><p id="B9781876938437500090-p0125">Although the product of any index is metadata, this does not mean that all metadata are indexed (and therefore used as access points). Some types of information may be deemed worth recording, but not considered to be what users would normally search on – such as the number of pages a book has. Thus, library cataloguing distinguishes between description and indexing. Bibliographic description is set out in a particular way to be <em>read</em>, once the record has been retrieved via the index. Not all of this description would necessarily be indexed, indeed, most will usually not be, but users may want to read it, in order to select or deselect an item – they may be interested in how long a book is or when it was published, for instance.</p><p id="B9781876938437500090-p0130">It may also be that the information is represented in a way that makes it less appropriate for indexing, for instance, it may be in whole sentences rather than a few key terms. Nowadays, many IR systems can retrieve on any word (or number), but this does not mean that everything should be indexed. Words such as ‘a’ and ‘the’ are too common, as well as almost meaningless, to be of much use, and are often not indexed (these are referred to as stop words). The fewer terms indexed, the more likely it is the system will retrieve relevant documents (and less irrelevant ones). The more terms indexed the more likely it is that the system will retrieve more documents that are relevant, but also more irrelevant ones. This brings up a key issue in indexing – vocabulary control.</p></section></div></div><div class="snippet-ctas u-remove-if-print"><a href="/science/article/pii/B9781876938437500090" target="_blank" role="button" class="view-chapter-button link-button link-button-primary" aria-describedby="tp-snippet-chp-title-B9781876938437500090" data-aa-region="aa-tp-snippet-read-full-chp" data-aa-name="" data-hack="#"><span class="link-button-text">View chapter</span></a><a class="link-button link-button-secondary" role="button" href="https://www.elsevier.com/books/T/A/9781876938437" target="_blank" data-aa-region="aa-tp-purchase-book" data-aa-name=""><span class="link-button-text">Purchase book</span></a></div></article><article class="snippet"><div class="snippet-content"><h2 class="u-font-serif u-text-light" id="tp-snippet-chp-title-B9780123748577000025"><a class="anchor" href="/science/article/pii/B9780123748577000025" data-aa-region="aa-tp-snippet-chp-title" data-aa-name="People in digital libraries" data-hack="#"><span class="anchor-text">People in digital libraries</span></a></h2><div class="size-l"><cite><p><span>Ian H.

However, these systems focus on specifying queries or presenting results in a manner that helps users quickly find an item of interest. For image searches, in particular, there has been relatively little work on new interfaces, visualizations, and interaction techniques that support users in browsing images.</p><p id="B9781558609150500123-para2">Image browsing is important for a number of reasons. First of all, no matter what information retrieval system is being used, the user has to browse the results of the search. It is certainly important to build query systems that help users get results that are as close to what is wanted as possible. But there will always be images that need to be browsed visually to make the final pick.</p><p id="B9781558609150500123-para3">Most image browsing systems present the images as a grid of thumbnails that the user can scroll through with a vertical scrollbar, and see a high resolution version of the image with some mouse interaction. There are also a few alternative designs, such as manually constructed digital photo albums, and one commercial zoomable image browser.</p><p id="B9781558609150500123-para4">A second reason for needing new image browsers is more subtle, and was actually my primary motivation for doing the present work. Sometimes, people browse images just for the pleasure of looking at those images, and they often do it with other people. This is especially true for personal photos. As people take more digital family pictures, we need better tools to support users in home settings as they look at those pictures together on a computer screen. Looking at borne photos has a lot of overlap with traditional retrieval systems. People still want to be able to find photos of particular people and events, etc. However, they are less likely to be time pressured to find a particular photo, and more likely to be interested in serendipity - that is, finding photos they weren&#x27;t looking for [<span>6</span>].</p><p id="B9781558609150500123-para5"><span id="B9781558609150500123-p67"></span>1 found I needed better tools to look at pictures with my two-year-old daughter. I did not want to spend the time to make custom “albums”. In addition, I found using traditional software with a grid of thumbnails, scrollbars, and popup viewer windows unpleasant in this context I wanted to concentrate on the images - and more importantly, as I was looking at the photos with my daughter, it was crucial that she be an active part of the interaction, and not just a passive bystander.</p><p id="B9781558609150500123-para6">Motivated by the need of a tool that would support browsing of images with my family, I started to investigate techniques for presenting collections of images or other visual data. While much work has been done on visualizing complex datasets, surprisingly few techniques are available for presenting images. My goal was to come up with a mechanism that would be able to lay out groups of images automatically in a way that would offer a simple interface to browse while giving access to a large set of images and their context</p><div><div><p>To this end, I developed PhotoMesa, a zoomable image browser that organizes images in a two-dimensional grid, where images with a shared attribute (such as directory location, nearness in time, or a shared word in their filename) are grouped together (<span>Figure 1</span>). It uses zooming and simple interaction techniques to make navigation straightforward, and to eliminate the possibility of getting lost. In building PhotoMesa, 1 kept the following design goals in mind:</p><figure id="B9781558609150500123-f1"><div class="download-image"><div class="image-holder"><script src="https://ajax.cloudflare.com/cdn-cgi/scripts/7089c43e/cloudflare-static/rocket-loader.min.js" data-cf-settings="7ff00e32f57780ebd137c054-|49"></script><img loading="lazy" src="https://ars.els-cdn.com/content/image/3-s2.0-B9781558609150500123-f11-01-9781558609150.jpg?_" height="320" alt="" crossorigin="anonymous" onerror="this.onerror=null;window.IMG_NO_CORS=!0;this.removeAttribute('crossorigin');this.src=this.src.replace(/\?.*$/,'')" /></div><div class="u-margin-s-ver text-s u-remove-if-print"></div></div><div class="captions"><span id="B9781558609150500123-cecap1"><p id="B9781558609150500123-spara1"><span class="label">Figure 1</span>.

Treemaps are a family of algorithms that partition two-dimensional space into regions that have an area proportional to a list of requested areas. The problem with existing treemap algorithms is that they return areas of arbitrary aspect ratios. A requirement of photo display is that the regions that show groups of photos must have dimensions that are integer multiples of the dimensions of the photos – that is, they must be sized to contain <em>quantum</em>, or indivisible contents. The use of treemaps to display images is the first known use of treemaps to display visual content, such as images, rather then just using the size and color of the rectangles to visualize two numerical attributes of a dataset.</p><p id="B9781558609150500123-para12">The bubblemap algorithm generates non-rectangular groups. The groups are generated with a grid-based recursive fill algorithm. They fill all the cells in a grid leaving almost do unused space, and generate groups of images that are approximately rectangular or circular.</p><p id="B9781558609150500123-para13">This paper describes PhotoMesa and the quantum treemap and bubblemap layout algorithms.

The <em>traditional</em> search-by-example, according to the type of similarity required, is useful for musicologists searching for pieces inspired by a melody. Lastly come searches orientated towards comparing whole soundtracks or their parts, proving useful in ‘investigations’ for copyright purposes into cases of plagiarism or quotation. AR techniques have numerous practical applications: identifying songs transmitted by broadcasters, also via a ‘common receiver’ connected to a treatment system; search for ‘suspicious’ sounds recorded by surveillance systems; and sound analysis of video and any type of application in television, radio or other media industry archive. Despite the novelty of its application, AR is making tasks faster and more efficient, and its applications are now present in a lot of commercial equipment.</p><p id="B9781843347224500060-p0285"><span id="B9781843347224500060-p191"></span>The survey moves on to describe the two techniques, AR or MIR, relative to ‘musical data’ structured on notes and ‘audio data’ in general. For musical data it is still necessary to distinguish between ‘monophonic and polyphonic melodies’. The most important issues in both cases are measuring differences between the compared data of the notes, which the system must be able to carry out automatically, and the construction of the data index, automatically or semi-automatically. ‘Distance measure’ and ‘indexing’ are processes closely linked to the degree of <em>matching,</em> set each time for the document’s retrieval, and the more broad and generic it is, the more the system can easily estimate the similarity between the parameters of the notes being compared, or between a parameter and indexing terms used.</p><p id="B9781843347224500060-p0290">For audio data not based on systems of notes, other features need to be singled out, even by ‘segmenting’ sound tracks into parts representative of their <em>structure.</em> These automatically detectable features are those typical to each sound object, namely tempo, frequency, amplitude, timbre, tone etc. The problem is in finding a scheme capable of composing the results of a track’s analysis in order to obtain a satisfactory and reliable enough model of its audio features. This is feasible, for example, by composing vectors such as audio-fingerprint, or as it is known, a ‘Self-organizing Map (SOM)’.</p><p id="B9781843347224500060-p0295">This panorama continues with quick descriptions and comparisons of the 17 most advanced AR systems, and the differing needs and characteristics of users. The authors take into account three classes of user, namely ‘industrial, professional, and general consumers’. These classes, to varying degrees of research, need single sound outputs, full tracks, information about composers, musical genres and classes of sounds. Objectives can be varied: copyright protection; search for music based on tastes and styles; search for the works of a given artist; and identification of tracks, etc.</p><p id="B9781843347224500060-p0300">In conclusion, a <em>map</em> is developed that attempts to discover how the functioning systems are able to match the needs of diverse users. However, the perpetual problem of the <em>gap</em> continues to weigh heavily when it becomes necessary to move from the ‘simple’ level of single track content retrieval to the more ‘complex’ level of the semantic identification of a genre.</p></section></div></div><div class="snippet-ctas u-remove-if-print"><a href="/science/article/pii/B9781843347224500060" target="_blank" role="button" class="view-chapter-button link-button link-button-primary" aria-describedby="tp-snippet-chp-title-B9781843347224500060" data-aa-region="aa-tp-snippet-read-full-chp" data-aa-name="" data-hack="#"><span class="link-button-text">View chapter</span></a><a class="link-button link-button-secondary" role="button" href="https://www.elsevier.com/books/T/A/9781843347224" target="_blank" data-aa-region="aa-tp-purchase-book" data-aa-name=""><span class="link-button-text">Purchase book</span></a></div></article><article class="snippet"><div class="snippet-content"><h2 class="u-font-serif u-text-light" id="tp-snippet-chp-title-B9781876938604500082"><a class="anchor" href="/science/article/pii/B9781876938604500082" data-aa-region="aa-tp-snippet-chp-title" data-aa-name="Information sources and services" data-hack="#"><span class="anchor-text">Information sources and services</span></a></h2><div class="size-l"><cite><p><span>Stuart Ferguson, Rodney Hebels, in </span><a href="/book/9781876938604" class="anchor" data-aa-region="aa-tp-snippet-bk-title" data-aa-name="Computers for Librarians (Third Edition)" data-hack="#"><span class="anchor-text">Computers for Librarians (Third Edition)</span></a>, 2003</p></cite><section id="B9781876938604500082-cesec34"><h3>Review questions</h3><div><dl class="article-list"><dt>1.</dt><dd><p id="B9781876938604500082-para273">Explain what a field is.</p></dd><dt>2.</dt><dd><p id="B9781876938604500082-para274">Name the main components in an online information retrieval system.</p></dd><dt>3.</dt><dd><p id="B9781876938604500082-para275">Identify the most common indexing parameters applied to text retrieval systems.</p></dd><dt>4.</dt><dd><p id="B9781876938604500082-para276">Name the main techniques for narrowing a database search.</p></dd><dt>5.</dt><dd><p id="B9781876938604500082-para277"><span id="B9781876938604500082-p78"></span>Identify three kinds of help facility available to users of commercial databases.</p></dd><dt>6.</dt><dd><p id="B9781876938604500082-para278">Name two solutions to the limitations of boolean searching discussed in this chapter.</p></dd><dt>7.</dt><dd><p id="B9781876938604500082-para279">Name the main elements that make up a user profile in SDI.</p></dd><dt>8.</dt><dd><p id="B9781876938604500082-para280">Explain the difference between the index file in a commercial database and the subject index or descriptor field.</p></dd><dt>9.</dt><dd><p id="B9781876938604500082-para281">Outline the decisions to be made in the development of an inhouse database.</p></dd><dt>10.</dt><dd><p id="B9781876938604500082-para282">Outline the main technologies that contribute to the development of document delivery services.</p></dd></dl></div></section></div></div><div class="snippet-ctas u-remove-if-print"><a href="/science/article/pii/B9781876938604500082" target="_blank" role="button" class="view-chapter-button link-button link-button-primary" aria-describedby="tp-snippet-chp-title-B9781876938604500082" data-aa-region="aa-tp-snippet-read-full-chp" data-aa-name="" data-hack="#"><span class="link-button-text">View chapter</span></a><a class="link-button link-button-secondary" role="button" href="https://www.elsevier.com/books/T/A/9781876938604" target="_blank" data-aa-region="aa-tp-purchase-book" data-aa-name=""><span class="link-button-text">Purchase book</span></a></div></article><article class="snippet"><div class="snippet-content"><h2 class="u-font-serif u-text-light" id="tp-snippet-chp-title-B9781843347811500086"><a class="anchor" href="/science/article/pii/B9781843347811500086" data-aa-region="aa-tp-snippet-chp-title" data-aa-name="Metacognitive skills and online search behavior" data-hack="#"><span class="anchor-text">Metacognitive skills and online search behavior</span></a></h2><div class="size-l"><cite><p><span>Barbara Blummer, Jeffrey M.

The author found that individuals’ mental models affected their search outcomes and feelings toward the search. Zhang concluded that individuals’ construction of mental models of the web was linked by their experiences and included personal observation, classroom instruction, and communication. Users’ mental models’ of databases are based on their perceptions of information systems and are modified with continued experience (</span><span>Zhang, 2013</span>). <span>Zhang’s (2013)</span> study of users interaction with Medline Plus suggested that individuals’ development of a mental model of one system evolved from their experiences with another system. According to the author, this centered on “assimilating new elements into the mental models and modifying the existing elements” (p. 168). <span>Yang’s (1997)</span> examination of six students’ information seeking in a database over time revealed a progression of mental models that “appeared to move from chaos to order, and fuzzy to clear, and they were clearly open to change” (p. 86).</p><p id="B9781843347811500086-p0085">Foremost, research highlights the importance of users’ mental models of information systems in influencing their search behaviors. As <span>Connell (1995)</span> reminds us, “the more one knows about a system the more effective he or she will be in using the systems” (p. 507). She underscored the importance of users’ mental models in identifying appropriate library databases as well as library records. She pointed to “specific entry” concept in cataloging that assigned record descriptors based on narrow subject headings (p. 506).</p><p id="B9781843347811500086-p0090"><span id="B9781843347811500086-p82"></span>College students’ lack of mental models in searching databases and the web was noted by <span>Holman (2011)</span>. She observed students searching the web and databases, and concluded that most individuals lacked a robust mental model, and this affected their search precision. She found students understood search engines’ efforts to match keywords to indexes, but she argued that participants failed to apply the knowledge to searches and did not “troubleshoot particular problems” (p. 25). In addition, <span>Slone (2002)</span> observed that users’ understanding of systems stemmed from “mental models, expectations and experience” (p. 1153). Still, she noted the use of mental models can be problematic if users develop similar mental models for dissimilar systems such as online-catalogs and the web. <span>Zhang (2008a</span>, <span>2008b</span>) seemingly concurred in her prediction that students’ mental models of the web as an information retrieval system would affect their behaviors with other databases.</p></section></div></div><div class="snippet-ctas u-remove-if-print"><a href="/science/article/pii/B9781843347811500086" target="_blank" role="button" class="view-chapter-button link-button link-button-primary" aria-describedby="tp-snippet-chp-title-B9781843347811500086" data-aa-region="aa-tp-snippet-read-full-chp" data-aa-name="" data-hack="#"><span class="link-button-text">View chapter</span></a><a class="link-button link-button-secondary" role="button" href="https://www.elsevier.com/books/T/A/9781843347811" target="_blank" data-aa-region="aa-tp-purchase-book" data-aa-name=""><span class="link-button-text">Purchase book</span></a></div></article><article class="snippet"><div class="snippet-content"><h2 class="u-font-serif u-text-light" id="tp-snippet-chp-title-B9781876938604500112"><a class="anchor" href="/science/article/pii/B9781876938604500112" data-aa-region="aa-tp-snippet-chp-title" data-aa-name="Generic data management software" data-hack="#"><span class="anchor-text">Generic data management software</span></a></h2><div class="size-l"><cite><p><span>Stuart Ferguson, Rodney Hebels, in </span><a href="/book/9781876938604" class="anchor" data-aa-region="aa-tp-snippet-bk-title" data-aa-name="Computers for Librarians (Third Edition)" data-hack="#"><span class="anchor-text">Computers for Librarians (Third Edition)</span></a>, 2003</p></cite><section id="B9781876938604500112-cesec1"><h3><span id="B9781876938604500112-p144"></span>Text retrieval systems</h3><p id="B9781876938604500112-para6">The term ‘text retrieval system’ is used here in preference to a number of other terms, such as ‘information retrieval system’ (a term often used in reference work to describe commercial host systems) or ‘information management system’ (often used in the organisational context to describe an inhouse system). ‘Text retrieval system’ is used, first, because it is a more generic term (describing both host and inhouse systems) and, second, because text retrieval is a most apt description of what this type of system actually does. Its main function is to enable the user to locate occurrences of specified text within a document or a file, such as the keywords input in a boolean search of an online database or a web resource.</p><p id="B9781876938604500112-para7">It is worth noting that text retrieval systems focus on retrieval rather than on the manipulation of data. The latter is an important feature of database management systems and is a requirement of the library management systems described in <span>Chapter 4</span>: for example, circulation and acquisitions functions. Libraries generally require systems that will both retrieve text and manipulate data. Once both text retrieval and database management systems have been examined, the distinction between the two will be discussed.</p></section></div></div><div class="snippet-ctas u-remove-if-print"><a href="/science/article/pii/B9781876938604500112" target="_blank" role="button" class="view-chapter-button link-button link-button-primary" aria-describedby="tp-snippet-chp-title-B9781876938604500112" data-aa-region="aa-tp-snippet-read-full-chp" data-aa-name="" data-hack="#"><span class="link-button-text">View chapter</span></a><a class="link-button link-button-secondary" role="button" href="https://www.elsevier.com/books/T/A/9781876938604" target="_blank" data-aa-region="aa-tp-purchase-book" data-aa-name=""><span class="link-button-text">Purchase book</span></a></div></article><article class="snippet"><div class="snippet-content"><h2 class="u-font-serif u-text-light" id="tp-snippet-chp-title-B9780128029169000099"><a class="anchor" href="/science/article/pii/B9780128029169000099" data-aa-region="aa-tp-snippet-chp-title" data-aa-name="The Limitations of Automating OSINT: Understanding the Question, Not the Answer" data-hack="#"><span class="anchor-text">The Limitations of Automating OSINT: Understanding the Question, Not the Answer</span></a></h2><div class="size-l"><cite><p><span>George R.S.

Advances in technology can help to address these issues and move toward fully automated OSINT. The greatest challenge is to correctly interpret the user’s intended search in the face of ill-formulated search expressions and ambiguity. We may hope that this technical challenge can be met. Perhaps practical insight may be sought in the view of Marshall McLuhan: “Anybody who begins to examine the patterns of automation finds that perfecting the individual machine by making it automatic involves “feedback.” That means introducing an information loop or circuit, where before there had been merely a one way flow or mechanical sequence” (<span>McLuhan, 1964</span>, p. 354).</p><p id="B9780128029169000099-p0190">Realistically, we might aim for an information loop rather than a one-way flow to attain a practical middle ground in which an interactive semiautomated system allows users to pose queries and respond to intermediate results as a means of refining and reexpressing their information objectives (cf. Moussa, et al., 2007; Kovashka et al., 2012). Employing a feedback loop to refine an information envelope could meet the dual problems of ill-defined search and poorly formulated information needs. In this fashion, we may have a system that is properly focussed on understanding the question, not the answer. <span id="B9780128029169000099-p168"></span></p></section></div></div><div class="snippet-ctas u-remove-if-print"><a href="/science/article/pii/B9780128029169000099" target="_blank" role="button" class="view-chapter-button link-button link-button-primary" aria-describedby="tp-snippet-chp-title-B9780128029169000099" data-aa-region="aa-tp-snippet-read-full-chp" data-aa-name="" data-hack="#"><span class="link-button-text">View chapter</span></a><a class="link-button link-button-secondary" role="button" href="https://www.elsevier.com/books/T/A/9780128029169" target="_blank" data-aa-region="aa-tp-purchase-book" data-aa-name=""><span class="link-button-text">Purchase book</span></a></div></article><article class="snippet"><div class="snippet-content"><h2 class="u-font-serif u-text-light" id="tp-snippet-chp-title-B9780124115194000069"><a class="anchor" href="/science/article/pii/B9780124115194000069" data-aa-region="aa-tp-snippet-chp-title" data-aa-name="Latent Dirichlet Allocation" data-hack="#"><span class="anchor-text">Latent Dirichlet Allocation</span></a></h2><div class="size-l"><cite><p><span>Joshua Charles Campbell, ...

Words such as ‘a’ and ‘the’ are too common, as well as almost meaningless, to be of much use, and are often not indexed (these are referred to as stop words). The fewer terms indexed, the more likely it is the system will retrieve relevant documents (and less irrelevant ones).
