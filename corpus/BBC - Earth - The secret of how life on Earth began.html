There can hardly be a bigger question. For much of human history, almost everyone believed some version of \"the gods did it\". Any other explanation was inconceivable.</p><p>That is no longer true. Over the last century, a few scientists have tried to figure out how the first life might have sprung up. They have even tried to recreate this Genesis moment in their labs: to create brand-new life from scratch.</p><p>So far nobody has managed it, but we have come a long way. Today, many of the scientists studying the origin of life are confident that they are on the right track &ndash; and they have the experiments to back up their confidence.</p><p>This is the story of our quest to discover our ultimate origin. It is a story of obsession, struggle and brilliant creativity, which encompasses some of the greatest discoveries of modern science. The endeavour to understand life's beginnings has sent men and women to the furthest corners of our planet. Some of the scientists involved have been bedevilled as monsters, while others had to do their work under the heel of brutal totalitarian governments.</p><p>This is the story of the birth of life on Earth.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p04dbtkn\"}}</p><p>Life is old. The dinosaurs are perhaps the most famous extinct creatures, and they had their beginnings 250 million years ago. But life dates back much further.</p><p>The <a href=\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1089/ast.2013.1030\">oldest</a> <a href=\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/ngeo1238\">known</a> <a href=\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.precamres.2007.04.013\">fossils</a> are around 3.5 billion years old, 14 times the age of the oldest dinosaurs. But the fossil record may stretch back still further. For instance, in August 2016 researchers found <a href=\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/nature19355\" target=\"_blank\">what appear to be fossilised microbes</a> dating back <a href=\"http://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-37235447\">3.7 billion years</a>.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p04ddzqq\"}}</p><p>The Earth itself is not much older, having formed 4.5 billion years ago.</p><p>If we assume that life formed on Earth &ndash; which seems reasonable, given that <a href=\"http://www.bbc.com/earth/story/20150429-will-we-find-aliens\">we have not yet found it anywhere else</a> &ndash; then it must have done so in the billion years between Earth coming into being and the preservation of the oldest known fossils.</p><p>As well as narrowing down when life began, we can make an educated guess at what it was.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p04cl3wf\"}}</p><p>Since the 19th Century, biologists have known that all living things are made of \"cells\": tiny bags of living matter that come in different shapes and sizes. Cells were first discovered in the 17th Century, when the first modern microscopes were invented, but it took well over a century for anyone to realise that they were the basis of all life.</p><blockquote><p> Using only the materials and conditions found on the Earth over 3.5 billion years ago, we have to make a cell </p></blockquote><p>You might not think you look much like a catfish or a <em>Tyrannosaurus rex</em>, but a microscope will reveal that you are all made of pretty similar kinds of cells. So are plants and fungi.</p><p>But by far the most numerous forms of life are microorganisms, each of which is made up of just one cell. Bacteria are the most famous group, and they are found everywhere on Earth.</p><p>In April 2016, scientists presented <a href=\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/nmicrobiol.2016.48\">an updated version of the \"tree of life\"</a>: a kind of family tree for every living species. Almost all of the branches are bacteria. What's more, the shape of the tree suggests that a bacterium was the common ancestor of all life. In other words, every living thing &ndash; including you &ndash; is ultimately descended from a bacterium.</p><p>This means we can define the problem of the origin of life more precisely. Using only the materials and conditions found on the Earth over 3.5 billion years ago, we have to make a cell.</p><p>Well, how hard can it be?</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p04clbmb\"}}</p><p><strong>Chapter 1. The first experiments</strong></p><p>For most of history, it was not really considered necessary to ask how life began, because the answer seemed obvious.</p><p>Before the 1800s, most people believed in \"vitalism\". This is the intuitive idea that living things were endowed with a special, magical property that made them different from inanimate objects.</p><blockquote><p> The chemicals of life can all be made from simpler chemicals that have nothing to do with life </p></blockquote><p>Vitalism was often bound up with cherished religious beliefs. The Bible says that God used \"<a href=\"https://www.kingjamesbibleonline.org/Genesis-2-7/\">the breath of life</a>\" to animate the first humans, and the immortal soul is a form of vitalism.</p><p>There is just one problem. Vitalism is plain wrong.</p><p>By the early 1800s, scientists had discovered several substances that seemed to be unique to life. One such chemical was urea, which is found in urine and was isolated in 1799.</p><p>This was still, just, compatible with vitalism. Only living things seemed to be able to make these chemicals, so perhaps they were infused with life energy and that was what made them special.</p><p>But in 1828, the German chemist Friedrich W&ouml;hler found <a href=\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/andp.18280880206\">a way to make urea from a common chemical called ammonium cyanate</a>, which had no obvious connection with living things. Others followed in his footsteps, and it was soon clear that the chemicals of life can all be made from simpler chemicals that have nothing to do with life.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p04d7cft\"}}</p><p>This was the end of vitalism as a scientific concept. But people found it profoundly hard to let go of the idea. For many, saying that there is nothing \"special\" about the chemicals of life seemed to rob life of its magic, to reduce us to mere machines. It also, of course, contradicted the Bible.</p><blockquote><p> The mystery of life's origin was ignored for decades </p></blockquote><p>Even scientists have struggled to shed vitalism. As late as 1913, the English biochemist Benjamin Moore was fervently pushing a theory of \"<a href=\"http://www.readbookonline.net/readOnLine/20877/\">biotic energy</a>\", which was essentially vitalism under a different name. The idea had a strong emotional hold.</p><p>Today the idea clings on in unexpected places. For example, there are plenty of science-fiction stories in which a person's \"life energy\" can be boosted or drained away. Think of the \"regeneration energy\" used by the Time Lords in <em>Doctor Who</em>, <a href=\"http://tardis.wikia.com/wiki/The_Time_of_the_Doctor_%28TV_story%29\">which can even be topped up if it runs low</a>. This feels futuristic, but it is a deeply old-fashioned idea.</p><p>Still, after 1828 scientists had legitimate reasons to look for a deity-free explanation for how the first life formed. But they did not. It seems like an obvious subject to explore, but in fact the mystery of life's origin was ignored for decades. Perhaps everyone was still too emotionally attached to vitalism to take the next step.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p04d7hrq\"}}</p><p>Instead, the big biological breakthrough of the 19th Century was <a href=\"http://www.bbc.com/earth/story/20150803-how-do-we-know-evolution-is-real\">the theory of evolution</a>, as developed by Charles Darwin and others.</p><blockquote><p> Darwin knew that it was a profound question </p></blockquote><p>Darwin's theory, set out in <em>On the Origin of Species</em> in 1859, explained how the vast diversity of life could all have arisen from a single common ancestor. Instead of each of the different species being created individually by God, they were all descended from a primordial organism that lived millions of years ago: the last universal common ancestor.</p><p>This idea proved immensely controversial, again because it contradicted the Bible. Darwin and his ideas came under ferocious attack, particularly from outraged Christians.</p><p>The theory of evolution said nothing about how that first organism came into being.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p04cl2qn\"}}</p><p>Darwin knew that it was a profound question, but &ndash; perhaps wary of starting yet another fight with the Church &ndash; he only seems to have discussed the issue <a href=\"http://www.darwinproject.ac.uk/editors-blog/2012/02/15/darwins-warm-little-pond/\">in a letter written in 1871</a>. His excitable language reveals that he knew the deep significance of the question:</p><blockquote><p> The first hypothesis for the origin of life was invented in a savagely totalitarian country </p></blockquote><p>\"But if (&amp; oh what a big if) we could conceive in some warm little pond with all sorts of ammonia &amp; phosphoric salts,&mdash;light, heat, electricity &amp;c present, that a protein compound was chemically formed, ready to undergo still more complex changes...\"</p><p>In other words, what if there was once a small body of water, filled with simple organic compounds and bathed in sunlight. Some of those compounds might combine to form a life-like substance such as a protein, which could then start evolving and becoming more complex.</p><p>It was a sketchy idea. But it would become the basis of the first hypothesis for how life began.</p><p>This idea emerged from an unexpected place. You might think that this daring piece of free thinking would have been developed in a democratic country with a tradition of free speech: perhaps the United States. But in fact the first hypothesis for the origin of life was invented in a savagely totalitarian country, where free thinking was stamped out: the USSR.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p04cl29f\"}}</p><p>In Stalin's Russia, everything was under the control of the state. That included people's ideas, even on subjects &ndash; like biology &ndash; that seem unrelated to Communist politics.</p><blockquote><p> Oparin imagined what Earth was like when it was newly formed </p></blockquote><p>Most famously, Stalin effectively banned scientists from studying conventional genetics. Instead he imposed <a href=\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10739-011-9287-3\">the ideas</a> of a farm worker named <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00bw51j\">Trofim Lysenko</a>, which he thought were more in line with Communist ideology. Scientists working on genetics were forced to publicly support Lysenko's ideas, or risk ending up in a labour camp.</p><p>It was in this repressive environment that Alexander Oparin carried out his research into biochemistry. He was able to keep working because he was a loyal Communist: he supported Lysenko's ideas and even received the Order of Lenin, the highest decoration that could be bestowed on someone living in the USSR.</p><p>In 1924, Oparin published his book <a href=\"http://www.valencia.edu/~orilife/textos/The%20Origin%20of%20Life.pdf\"><em>The Origin of Life</em></a>. In it he set out a vision for the birth of life that was startlingly similar to Darwin's warm little pond.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p04cl221\"}}</p><p>Oparin imagined what Earth was like when it was newly formed. The surface was searingly hot, as rocks from space plunged down onto it and impacted. It was a mess of semi-molten rocks, containing a huge range of chemicals &ndash; including many based on carbon.</p><blockquote><p> If you watch coacervates under a microscope, they behave unnervingly like living cells </p></blockquote><p>Eventually the Earth cooled enough for water vapour to condense into liquid water, and the first rain fell. Before long Earth had oceans, which were hot and rich in carbon-based chemicals. Now two things could happen.</p><p>First, the various chemicals could react with each other to form lots of new compounds, some of which would be more complex. Oparin supposed that the molecules central to life, like sugars and amino acids, could all have formed in Earth's waters.</p><p>Second, some of the chemicals began to form microscopic structures. Many organic chemicals do not dissolve in water: for example, oil forms a layer on top of water. But when some of these chemicals contact water they form spherical globules called \"coacervates\", which can be up to 0.01cm (0.004 inches) across.</p><p>If you watch coacervates under a microscope, they behave unnervingly like living cells. They grow and change shape, and sometimes divide into two. They can also take in chemicals from the surrounding water, so life-like chemicals can become concentrated inside them. Oparin proposed that coacervates were the ancestors of modern cells.</p><blockquote><p> The idea that living organisms formed by purely chemical means, without a god or even a \"life force\", was radical </p></blockquote><p>Five years later in 1929, the English biologist J. B. S. Haldane independently proposed some very similar ideas in <a href=\"http://www.uv.es/~orilife/textos/Haldane.pdf\">a short article</a> published in the <a href=\"https://newhumanist.org.uk/history\"><em>Rationalist Annual</em></a>.</p><p>Haldane had already made enormous contributions to evolutionary theory, helping to integrate Darwin's ideas with the emerging science of genetics.</p><p>He was also a larger-than-life character. On one occasion, he suffered a perforated eardrum thanks to some experiments with decompression chambers, but later wrote that: \"the drum generally heals up; and if a hole remains in it, although one is somewhat deaf, one can blow tobacco smoke out of the ear in question, which is a social accomplishment.\"</p><p>Just like Oparin, Haldane outlined how organic chemicals could build up in water, \"[until] the primitive oceans reached the consistency of hot dilute soup\". This set the stage for \"the first living or half-living things\" to form, and for each one to become enclosed in \"an oily film\".</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p04clbq0\"}}</p><p>It is telling that of all the biologists in the world, it was Oparin and Haldane who proposed this. The idea that living organisms formed by purely chemical means, without a god or even a \"life force\", was radical. Like Darwin's theory of evolution before it, it flew in the face of Christianity.</p><blockquote><p> There was one problem. There was no experimental evidence to back it up </p></blockquote><p>That suited the USSR just fine. The Soviet regime was officially atheist, and its leaders were eager to support materialistic explanations for profound phenomena like life. Haldane was also an atheist, and a devoted communist to boot.</p><p>\"At that time, to accept or not accept this idea depended essentially on personalities: whether they were religious or whether they supported left or communist ideas,\" says origin-of-life expert <a href=\"https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Q7YTFCQAAAAJ&amp;hl=en\">Armen Mulkidjanian</a> of the University of Osnabr&uuml;ck in Germany. \"In the Soviet Union they were accepted happily because they didn't need God. In the western world, if you look for people who were thinking in this direction, they all were lefties, communists and so on.\"</p><p>The idea that life formed in a primordial soup of organic chemicals became known as the Oparin-Haldane hypothesis. It was neat and compelling, but there was one problem. There was no experimental evidence to back it up. This would not arrive for almost a quarter of a century.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p04cl39t\"}}</p><p>By the time <a href=\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1098/rsbm.1983.0022\">Harold Urey</a> became interested in the origin of life, he had already <a href=\"http://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/chemistry/laureates/1934/\">won the 1934 Nobel Prize in Chemistry</a> and helped to build the atomic bomb. During World War Two Urey worked on the Manhattan Project, collecting the unstable uranium-235 needed for the bomb's core. After the war he fought to keep nuclear technology in civilian control.</p><blockquote><p> In 1952, Miller began the most famous experiment on the origin of life ever attempted </p></blockquote><p>He also became interested in the chemistry of outer space, particularly what went on when the Solar System was first forming. One day he gave a lecture and pointed out that there was probably no oxygen in Earth's atmosphere when it first formed. This would have offered the ideal conditions for Oparin and Haldane's primordial soup to form: the fragile chemicals would have been destroyed by contact with oxygen.</p><p>A doctoral student named Stanley Miller was in the audience, and later approached Urey with a proposal: could they test this idea? Urey was sceptical, but Miller talked him into it.</p><p>So in 1952, Miller began the most famous experiment on the origin of life ever attempted.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p04clc2m\"}}</p><p>The set-up was simple. Miller connected a series of glass flasks and circulated four chemicals that he suspected were present on the early Earth: boiling water, hydrogen gas, ammonia and methane. He subjected the gases to repeated electric shocks, to simulate the lightning strikes that would have been a common occurrence on Earth so long ago.</p><blockquote><p> You can go from a simple atmosphere and produce lots of biological molecules </p></blockquote><p>Miller found that \"the water in the flask became noticeably pink after the first day, and by the end of the week the solution was deep red and turbid\". Clearly, a mix of chemicals had formed.</p><p>When Miller analysed the mixture he found that it contained two amino acids: glycine and alanine. Amino acids are often described as the building blocks of life. They are used to form the proteins that control most biochemical processes in our bodies. Miller had made two of life's most important components, from scratch.</p><p><a href=\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1126/science.117.3046.528\">The results were published in the prestigious journal <em>Science</em> in 1953</a>. Urey, in a selfless act unusual among senior scientists, had his name taken off the paper, giving Miller sole credit. Despite this, the study is often known as the \"<a href=\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1126/science.1161527\">Miller-Urey experiment</a>\".</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p04cl1r3\"}}</p><p>\"The strength of Miller-Urey is to show that you can go from a simple atmosphere and produce lots of biological molecules,\" says <a href=\"http://www2.mrc-lmb.cam.ac.uk/group-leaders/n-to-s/john-sutherland/\">John Sutherland</a> of the Laboratory of Molecular Biology in Cambridge, UK.</p><blockquote><p> Life was more complicated than anyone had thought </p></blockquote><p>The details turned out to be wrong, since later studies showed that the early Earth's atmosphere had a different mix of gases. But that is almost beside the point.</p><p>\"It was massively iconic, stimulated the public's imagination and continues to be cited extensively,\" says Sutherland.</p><p>In the wake of Miller's experiment, other scientists began finding ways to make simple biological molecules from scratch. A solution to the mystery of the origin of life seemed close.</p><p>But then it became clear that life was more complicated than anyone had thought. Living cells, it turned out, were not just bags of chemicals: they were intricate little machines. Suddenly, making one from scratch began to look like a much bigger challenge than scientists had anticipated.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p04clbxg\"}}</p><p><strong>Chapter 2. The great polarisation</strong></p><p><em>By the early 1950s, scientists had moved away from the long-standing assumption that life was a gift from the gods. They had instead begun to explore the possibility that life formed spontaneously and naturally on the early Earth &ndash; and thanks to Stanley Miller's iconic experiment, they even had some practical support for the idea.</em></p><p>While Miller was trying to make the stuff of life from scratch, other scientists were figuring out what genes were made of.</p><p>By this time, many biological molecules were known. These included sugars, fats, proteins &ndash; and nucleic acids such as \"deoxyribonucleic acid\", or DNA for short.</p><blockquote><p> Theirs was one of the greatest scientific discoveries of the 20th Century </p></blockquote><p>Today we take it for granted that DNA carries our genes, but this actually came as a shock to 1950s biologists. Proteins are more complex, so scientists thought they were the genes.</p><p>That idea was disproved in 1952 by Alfred Hershey and Martha Chase of the Carnegie Institution of Washington. They studied simple viruses that only contain DNA and protein, and which have to infect bacteria in order to reproduce. They found that it was the viral DNA that entered the bacteria: <a href=\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1085/jgp.36.1.39\">the proteins stayed outside</a>. Clearly, DNA was the genetic material.</p><p>Hershey and Chase's findings triggered a frantic race to figure out the structure of DNA, and thus how it worked. The following year, the problem was cracked by <a href=\"https://profiles.nlm.nih.gov/ps/retrieve/Narrative/SC/p-nid/141\">Francis Crick</a> and <a href=\"http://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/medicine/laureates/1962/watson-bio.html\">James Watson</a> of the University of Cambridge, UK &ndash; with a lot of under-acknowledged help from their colleague <a href=\"https://profiles.nlm.nih.gov/ps/retrieve/Narrative/KR/p-nid/183\">Rosalind Franklin</a>.</p><p>Theirs was one of the greatest scientific discoveries of the 20th Century. It also reshaped the search for the origin of life, by revealing the incredible intricacy that is hidden inside living cells.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p04cl2x3\"}}</p><p>Crick and Watson realised that DNA is a double helix, like a ladder that has been twisted into a spiral. The two \"poles\" of the ladder are each built from molecules called nucleotides.</p><blockquote><p> Your genes ultimately come from an ancestral bacterium </p></blockquote><p>This structure explained how cells copy their DNA. In other words, it revealed how parents make copies of their genes and pass them on to their children.</p><p>The key point is that the double helix can be \"unzipped\". This exposes the genetic code &ndash; made up of sequences of the genetic bases A, T, C and G &ndash; that is normally locked away inside the DNA ladder&rsquo;s \"rungs\". Each strand is then used as a template to recreate a copy of the other.</p><p>Using this mechanism, genes have been passed down from parent to child since the beginning of life. Your genes ultimately come from an ancestral bacterium &ndash; and at every step they were copied using the mechanism Crick and Watson discovered.</p><p>Explore the structure of DNA in this video:</p><p>{\"video\":{ \"pid\": \"p04d79nw\",\"encoding\": \"ib2\" }}</p><p>Crick and Watson set out their findings in <a href=\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/171737a0\">a 1953 paper in <em>Nature</em></a>. Over the next few years, biochemists raced to figure out exactly what information DNA carries, and how that information is used in living cells. The innermost secrets of life were being exposed for the first time.</p><blockquote><p> Suddenly, Oparin and Haldane's ideas looked naively simple </p></blockquote><p>It turned out that DNA only has one job. <a href=\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/227561a0\">Your DNA tells your cells how to make proteins</a>: molecules that perform a host of essential tasks. Without proteins you could not digest your food, your heart would stop and you could not breathe.</p><p>But the process of using DNA to make proteins proved to be staggeringly intricate. That was a big problem for anyone trying to explain the origin of life, because it is hard to imagine how something so complex could ever have got started.</p><p>Each protein is essentially a long chain of amino acids, strung together in a specific order. The sequence of the amino acids determines the three-dimensional shape of the protein, and thus what it does.</p><p>That information is encoded <a href=\"http://users.rcn.com/jkimball.ma.ultranet/BiologyPages/C/Codons.html\">in the sequence of the DNA's bases</a>. So when a cell needs to make a particular protein, it reads the relevant gene in the DNA to get the sequence of amino acids.</p><blockquote><p> It turned out that DNA only has one job </p></blockquote><p>But there is a twist. DNA is precious, so cells prefer to keep it bundled away safely. For this reason, they copy the information from DNA onto short molecules of another substance called RNA (ribonucleic acid). If DNA is a library book, RNA is a scrap of paper with a key passage scribbled onto it. RNA is similar to DNA, except that it only has one strand.</p><p>Finally, the process of converting the information in that RNA strand into a protein takes place in an enormously elaborate molecule called a \"ribosome\".</p><p>This process is going on in every living cell, even the simplest bacteria. It is as essential to life as eating and breathing. Any explanation for the origin of life must show how this complex trinity &ndash; DNA, RNA and ribosome protein &ndash; came into existence and started working.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p04cl97n\"}}</p><p>Suddenly, Oparin and Haldane's ideas looked naively simple, while Miller's experiment, which only produced a few of the amino acids used to build proteins, looked amateurish. Far from taking us most of the way to creating life, his seminal study was clearly just the first step on a long road.</p><blockquote><p> The idea that life began with RNA would prove enormously influential </p></blockquote><p>\"DNA makes RNA makes protein, all in this lipid-encapsulated bag of chemicals,\" says John Sutherland. \"You look at that and it's just 'wow, that's too complicated'. How are we going to find organic chemistry that will make all that in one go?\"</p><p>The first person to really tackle this head-on was a British chemist named <a href=\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1098/rsbm.2013.0002\">Leslie Orgel</a>. He was one of the first to see Crick and Watson's model of DNA, and would later <a href=\"http://www.the-scientist.com/?articles.view/articleNo/25641/title/Leslie-Orgel-dies/\">help Nasa</a> with their Viking programme, which sent robotic landers to Mars.</p><p>Orgel set out to simplify the problem. <a href=\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0022-2836(68)90393-8\">Writing in 1968</a>, and <a href=\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0022-2836(68)90392-6\">supported by Crick</a>, he suggested that the first life did not have proteins or DNA. Instead, it was made almost entirely of RNA. For this to work, these primordial RNA molecules must have been particularly versatile. For one thing, they must have been able to build copies of themselves, presumably using the same base-pairing mechanism as DNA.</p><p>The idea that life began with RNA would prove enormously influential. But it also triggered a scientific turf war that has lasted until the present day.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p04cl2rf\"}}</p><p>By suggesting that life began with RNA and little else, Orgel was proposing that one crucial aspect of life &ndash; its ability to reproduce itself &ndash; appeared before all the others. In a sense, he was not just suggesting how life was first assembled: he was saying something about what life is.</p><blockquote><p> Scientists studying the origin of life split into camps </p></blockquote><p>Many biologists would agree with Orgel's \"replication first\" idea. In Darwin's theory of evolution, the ability to create offspring is absolutely central: the only way an organism can \"win\" is to leave behind lots of children.</p><p>But there are other features of life that seem equally essential. The most obvious is metabolism: the ability to extract energy from your surroundings and use it to keep yourself alive. For many biologists, metabolism must have been the original defining feature of life, with replication emerging later.</p><p>So from the 1960s onwards, scientists studying the origin of life split into camps.</p><p>\"The basic polarisation was metabolism-first versus genetics-first,\" says Sutherland.</p><blockquote><p> Scientific meetings on the origin of life have often been fractious affairs </p></blockquote><p>Meanwhile, a third group maintained that the first thing to appear was a container for the key molecules, to keep them from floating off. \"Compartmentalisation must have come first, because there's no point doing metabolism unless you're compartmentalised,\" says Sutherland. In other words, there needed to be a cell &ndash; as Oparin and Haldane had emphasised a few decades earlier &ndash; <a href=\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1023/A:1006746807104\">perhaps enclosed by a membrane of simple fats and lipids</a>.</p><p>All three ideas acquired adherents and have survived to the present day. Scientists have become passionately committed to their pet ideas, sometimes blindly so.</p><p>As a result, scientific meetings on the origin of life have often been fractious affairs, and journalists covering the subject are regularly told by a scientist in one camp that the ideas emerging from the other camps are stupid or worse.</p><p>Thanks to Orgel, the idea that life began with RNA and genetics got off to an early head start. Then came the 1980s, and a startling discovery that seemed to pretty much confirm it.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p04cl4d4\"}}</p><p><strong>Chapter 3. Search for the first replicator</strong></p><p><em>After the 1960s, the scientists on the quest to understand life's origins split into three groups. Some were convinced that life began with the formation of primitive versions of biological cells. Others thought the key first step was a metabolic system, and yet others focused on the importance of genetics and replication. This last group began trying to figure out what that first replicator might have looked like &ndash; with a focus on the idea that it was made of RNA.</em></p><p>As early as the 1960s, scientists had reason to think RNA was the source of all life.</p><p>Specifically, RNA can do something that DNA cannot. It is a single-stranded molecule, so unlike stiff, double-stranded DNA it can fold itself into a range of different shapes.</p><blockquote><p> You could not live without enzymes </p></blockquote><p>RNA's origami-like folding looked rather similar to the way proteins behave. Proteins are also basically long strands &ndash; made of amino acids rather than nucleotides &ndash; and this allows them to construct elaborate structures.</p><p>This is the key to proteins' most amazing ability. Some of them can speed up, or \"catalyse\", chemical reactions. These proteins are known as enzymes.</p><p>Many enzymes are found in your guts, where they break up the complex molecules from your food into simple ones like sugars that your cells can use. You could not live without enzymes.</p><p>Leslie Orgel and Francis Crick had a suspicion. If RNA could fold like a protein, maybe it could form enzymes. If that were true, RNA could have been the original &ndash; and highly versatile &ndash; living molecule, storing information as DNA does now and catalysing reactions as some proteins do.</p><p>It was a neat idea, but there would be no proof for over a decade.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p04dbcdt\"}}</p><p><a href=\"http://cechlab.colorado.edu/\">Thomas Cech</a> was born and raised in Iowa. As a child he was fascinated by rocks and minerals. By the time he was in junior high school he was visiting the local university and <a href=\"http://cech.checknobel.com/1.htm\">knocking on geologists' doors</a>, asking to see models of mineral structures.</p><p>But he eventually wound up becoming a biochemist, focusing on RNA.</p><blockquote><p> Now the notion that life began with RNA was looking promising </p></blockquote><p>In the early 1980s, Cech and his colleagues at the University of Colorado Boulder were studying a single-celled organism called <em>Tetrahymena thermophila</em>. Part of its cellular machinery includes strands of RNA. Cech found that one particular section of the RNA sometimes detached from the rest, as if something had cut it out with scissors.</p><p>When the team removed all the enzymes and other molecules that might be acting as molecular scissors, the RNA kept doing it. They had discovered <a href=\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0092-8674(82)90414-7\">the first RNA enzyme</a>: a short piece of RNA that was able to cut itself out of the larger strand it was part of.</p><p>Cech published the results in 1982. The following year, <a href=\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0092-8674(83)90117-4\">another group found a second RNA enzyme</a> &ndash; or \"ribozyme\", as it was dubbed.</p><p>Finding two RNA enzymes in quick succession suggested that there were plenty more out there.

A physicist who had become fascinated by molecular biology, Gilbert would also be one of the early advocates of <a href=\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/349099a0\">sequencing the human genome</a>.</p><blockquote><p> The RNA World is an elegant way to make complex life from scratch </p></blockquote><p><a href=\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/319618a0\">Writing in <em>Nature</em> in 1986</a>, Gilbert proposed that life began in the \"RNA World\".</p><p>The first stage of evolution, Gilbert argued, consisted of \"RNA molecules performing the catalytic activities necessary to assemble themselves from a nucleotide soup\". By cutting and pasting different bits of RNA together, the RNA molecules could create ever more useful sequences. Eventually they found a way to make proteins and protein enzymes, which proved so useful that they largely supplanted the RNA versions and gave rise to life as we recognise it today.</p><p>The RNA World is an elegant way to make complex life from scratch. Instead of having to rely on the simultaneous formation of dozens of biological molecules from the primordial soup, one Jack-of-all-trades molecule could do the work of all of them.</p><p>In 2000, the RNA World hypothesis was gifted a dramatic piece of supporting evidence.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p04cl9dg\"}}</p><p><a href=\"http://www.yale.edu/steitz/tom/tom.html\">Thomas Steitz</a> had spent 30 years studying the structures of the molecules in living cells. In the 1990s he took on his biggest challenge: figuring out the structure of the ribosome.</p><blockquote><p> The fact that this essential machine was based on RNA made the RNA World even more plausible </p></blockquote><p>Every living cell has a ribosome. This huge molecule reads instructions from RNA and strings together amino acids to make proteins. The ribosomes in your cells built most of your body.</p><p>The ribosome was known to contain RNA. But in 2000 Steitz's team produced <a href=\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1126/science.289.5481.920\">a detailed image of the ribosome's structure</a>, which showed that <a href=\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1126/science.289.5481.878\">the RNA was the catalytic core of the ribosome</a>.</p><p>This was critical, because the ribosome is so fundamental to life, and so ancient. The fact that this essential machine was based on RNA made the RNA World even more plausible.</p><p>RNA World supporters were ecstatic at the discovery, and in 2009 Steitz would receive a share of <a href=\"https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/chemistry/laureates/2009/\">a Nobel Prize</a>. But since then, doubts have crept back in.</p><p>Right from the start, there were two problems with the RNA World idea. Could RNA really perform all the functions of life by itself? And could it have formed on the early Earth?</p><blockquote><p> They set out to make a self-replicating RNA for themselves </p></blockquote><p>It is 30 years since Gilbert set out the stall for the RNA World, and we still do not have hard evidence that RNA can do all the things the theory demands of it. It is a handy little molecule, but it may not be handy enough.</p><p>One task stood out. If life began with an RNA molecule, that RNA must have been able to make copies of itself: it should have been self-replicating.</p><p>But no known RNA can self-replicate. Nor can DNA. It takes a battalion of enzymes and other molecules to build a replica copy of a piece of RNA or DNA.</p><p>So in the late 1980s, a few biologists started a rather quixotic quest. They set out to make a self-replicating RNA for themselves.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p04cl31q\"}}</p><p><a href=\"http://molbio.mgh.harvard.edu/szostakweb/\">Jack Szostak</a> of the Harvard Medical School was one of the first to get involved. As a child he was so fascinated with chemistry that he had a lab in his basement. With a splendid disregard for his own safety, <a href=\"http://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/medicine/laureates/2009/szostak-bio.html\">he once set off an explosion</a> that embedded a glass tube into the ceiling.</p><blockquote><p> They had showed that RNA enzymes could be truly powerful </p></blockquote><p>In the early 1980s, Szostak helped to show how our genes protect themselves against the ageing process. This early research would eventually <a href=\"http://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/medicine/laureates/2009/\">net him a share of a Nobel Prize</a>.</p><p>But he soon became fascinated by Cech's RNA enzymes. \"I thought that work was just really cool,\" he says. \"In principle, there might be a possibility for RNA to catalyse its own replication.\"</p><p>In 1988, Cech found <a href=\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1126/science.2450400\">an RNA enzyme that could build a short RNA molecule about 10 nucleotides long</a>. Szostak set out to improve on the discovery by evolving new RNA enzymes in the lab. His team created a pool of random sequences and tested them to see which ones showed catalytic activity. They then took those sequences, tweaked them, and tested again.</p><p>After 10 rounds of this, Szostak <a href=\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1126/science.7690155\">had produced an RNA enzyme that made a reaction go seven million times faster than it naturally would</a>. They had showed that RNA enzymes could be truly powerful. But their enzyme could not copy itself, not even close. Szostak had hit a wall.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p04dbh7k\"}}</p><p>The next big advance came in 2001 from Szostak's former student <a href=\"http://bartellab.wi.mit.edu/\">David Bartel</a>, of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in Cambridge. Bartel made an RNA enzyme called R18 that could add new nucleotides to a strand of RNA, based on an existing template. In other words, it was not just adding random nucleotides: it was correctly copying a sequence.</p><p>This was still not a self-replicator, but it was edging towards it. R18 consisted of a string of 189 nucleotides, and <a href=\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1126/science.1060786\">it could reliably add 11 nucleotides to a strand</a>: 6% of its own length. The hope was that a few tweaks would allow it to make a strand 189 nucleotides long &ndash; as long as itself.</p><blockquote><p> RNA does not seem to be up to the job of kick-starting life </p></blockquote><p>The best attempt came in 2011 from <a href=\"http://www2.mrc-lmb.cam.ac.uk/groups/ph1/\">Philipp Holliger</a> of the Laboratory of Molecular Biology in Cambridge, UK. <a href=\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1126/science.1200752\">His team created a modified R18 called tC19Z</a>, which copies sequences up to 95 nucleotides long. That is 48% of its own length: more than R18, but not the necessary 100%.</p><p>An alternative approach has been put forward by <a href=\"http://www.scripps.edu/joyce/\">Gerald Joyce</a> and Tracey Lincoln of the Scripps Research Institute in La Jolla, California. In 2009 they created <a href=\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1126/science.1167856\">an RNA enzyme that replicates itself indirectly</a>.</p><p>Their enzyme joins together two short pieces of RNA to create a second enzyme. This then joins together another two RNA pieces to recreate the original enzyme.</p><p>This simple cycle could be continued indefinitely, given the raw materials. But the enzymes only worked if they were given the correct RNA strands, which Joyce and Lincoln had to make.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p04dbhrf\"}}</p><p>For the many scientists who are sceptical about the RNA World, the lack of a self-replicating RNA is a fatal problem with the idea. RNA does not seem to be up to the job of kick-starting life.</p><blockquote><p> Maybe there was some other type of molecule on the early Earth </p></blockquote><p>The case has also been weakened by chemists' failure to make RNA from scratch. It looks like a simple molecule compared to DNA, but RNA has proved to be enormously difficult to make.</p><p>The problem is the sugar and the base that make up each nucleotide. It is possible to make each of them individually, but the two stubbornly refuse to link together.</p><p>This problem was already clear by the early 1990s. It left many biologists with a nagging suspicion that the RNA World hypothesis, while neat, could not be quite right.</p><p>Instead, maybe there was some other type of molecule on the early Earth: something simpler than RNA, which really could assemble itself out of the primordial soup and start self-replicating. This might have come first, and then led to RNA, DNA and the rest.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p04dbgn1\"}}</p><p>In 1991, <a href=\"http://icmm.ku.dk/english/icmm-staff/peter_e_nielsen/\">Peter Nielsen</a> of the University of Copenhagen in Denmark came up with a candidate for the primordial replicator.</p><p>It was essentially a heavily-modified version of DNA. Nielsen kept the bases the same &ndash; sticking with the A, T, C and G found in DNA &ndash; but made the backbone out of molecules called polyamides instead of the sugars found in DNA. He called the new molecule <a href=\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1126/science.1962210\">polyamide nucleic acid</a>, or PNA. Confusingly, it has since become known as peptide nucleic acid.</p><blockquote><p> PNA, unlike RNA, might have formed readily on the early Earth </p></blockquote><p>PNA has never been found in nature. But it behaves a lot like DNA. A strand of PNA can even take the place of one of the strands in a DNA molecule, with the complementary bases pairing up as normal. What's more, <a href=\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/368561a0\">PNA can coil up into a double helix</a>, just like DNA.</p><p>Stanley Miller was intrigued. Deeply sceptical about the RNA World, he suspected that <a href=\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/nsb0397-167\">PNA was a more plausible candidate for the first genetic material</a>.</p><p>In 2000 he produced some hard evidence.

He repeated his classic experiment, which we discussed in Chapter One, this time using methane, nitrogen, ammonia and water &ndash; and obtained the polyamide backbone of PNA.</p><p>This suggested that PNA, unlike RNA, might have formed readily on the early Earth.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p04cl2gn\"}}</p><p>Other chemists have come up with their own alternative nucleic acids.</p><blockquote><p> Each of these alternative nucleic acids has its supporters: usually, the person who made it </p></blockquote><p>In 2000, <a href=\"https://www.chab.ethz.ch/en/research/institutes/LOC/people/emeriti-professors/albert-eschenmoser.html\">Albert Eschenmoser</a> made <a href=\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1126/science.290.5495.1347\">threose nucleic acid</a> (TNA). This is basically DNA, but with a different sugar in its backbone. <a href=\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1126/science.290.5495.1306\">Strands of TNA can pair up to form a double helix</a>, and information can be copied back and forth between RNA and TNA.</p><p>What's more, <a href=\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/nchem.1241\">TNA can fold up into complex shapes</a>, and even bind to a protein.

But there is no trace of them in nature, so if the first life did use them, at some point it must have utterly abandoned them in favour of RNA and DNA. This might be true, but there is no evidence.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"\"}}</p><p>All this meant that, by the mid-2000s, supporters of the RNA World were in a quandary.</p><blockquote><p> The RNA World, neat as it was, could not be the whole truth </p></blockquote><p>On the one hand, RNA enzymes existed and they included one of the most important pieces of biological machinery, the ribosome. That was good.</p><p>But no self-replicating RNA had been found, and nobody could figure out how RNA formed in the primordial soup. The alternative nucleic acids might solve the latter problem, but there was no evidence they ever existed in nature. That was less good.</p><p>The obvious conclusion was that the RNA World, neat as it was, could not be the whole truth.</p><p>Meanwhile, a rival theory had been steadily gathering steam since the 1980s. Its supporters argue that life did not begin with RNA, or DNA, or any other genetic substance. Instead it began as a mechanism for harnessing energy.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p04cl36t\"}}</p><p><strong>Chapter 4. Power from protons</strong></p><p><em>We saw in Chapter Two how scientists divided into three schools of thought about how life began. One group was convinced that life began with a molecule of RNA, but they struggled to work out how RNA or similar molecules could have formed spontaneously on the early Earth and then made copies of themselves. Their efforts were exciting at first, but ultimately frustrating. However, even while this research was progressing, there were other origin-of-life researchers who felt sure that life began in a completely different way.</em></p><p>The RNA World theory relies on a simple idea: the most important thing a living organism can do is reproduce itself. Many biologists would agree with this. From bacteria to blue whales, all living things strive to have offspring.</p><blockquote><p> W&auml;chtersh&auml;user proposed that the first organisms were \"drastically different from anything we know\" </p></blockquote><p>However, many origin-of-life researchers do not believe reproduction is truly fundamental. Before an organism can reproduce, they say, it has to be self-sustaining. It must keep itself alive. After all, you cannot have kids if you die first.</p><p>We keep ourselves alive by eating food, while green plants do it by extracting energy from sunlight. You might not think that a person wolfing down a juicy steak looks much like a leafy oak tree, but when you get right down to it, both are taking in energy.</p><p>This process is called metabolism. First, you must obtain energy; say, from energy-rich chemicals like sugars. Then you must use that energy to build useful things like cells.</p><p>This process of harnessing energy is so utterly essential, many researchers believe it must have been the first thing life ever did.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p04dbljf\"}}</p><p>What might these metabolism-only organisms have looked like? One of the most influential suggestions <a href=\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0723-2020(88)80001-8\">was put forward in the late 1980s</a> by G&uuml;nter W&auml;chtersh&auml;user. He was not a full-time scientist, but rather a patent lawyer with a background in chemistry.</p><p>W&auml;chtersh&auml;user proposed that the first organisms were \"<a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC373159/\">drastically different from anything we know</a>\". They were not made of cells. They did not have enzymes, DNA or RNA.</p><blockquote><p> All the other things that make up modern organisms &ndash; like DNA, cells and brains &ndash; came later </p></blockquote><p>Instead, W&auml;chtersh&auml;user imagined a flow of hot water streaming out of a volcano. The water was rich in volcanic gases like ammonia, and held traces of minerals from the volcano's heart.</p><p>Where the water flowed over the rocks, chemical reactions began to take place. In particular, metals from the water helped simple organic compounds to fuse into larger ones.</p><p>The turning point was the creation of the first metabolic cycle. This is a process in which one chemical is converted into a series of other chemicals, until eventually the original chemical is recreated. In the process, the entire system takes in energy, which can be used to restart the cycle &ndash; and to start doing other things.</p><blockquote><p> Metabolic cycles may not seem life-like, but they are fundamental to life </p></blockquote><p>All the other things that make up modern organisms &ndash; like DNA, cells and brains &ndash; came later, built on the back of these chemical cycles.</p><p>These metabolic cycles do not sound much like life. W&auml;chtersh&auml;user called his inventions \"precursor organisms\" and wrote that they \"can barely be called living\".</p><p>But metabolic cycles like the ones W&auml;chtersh&auml;user described are at the core of every living thing. Your cells are essentially microscopic chemical processing plants, constantly turning one chemical into another. Metabolic cycles may not seem life-like, but they are fundamental to life.</p><p>Over the 1980s and 1990s, W&auml;chtersh&auml;user worked out his theory in considerable detail. He outlined which minerals made for the best surfaces and <a href=\"https://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.87.1.200\">which chemical cycles might take place</a>. His ideas began to attract supporters.</p><p>But it was all still theoretical. W&auml;chtersh&auml;user needed a real-world discovery that backed up his ideas. Fortunately, it had already been made &ndash; a decade earlier.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p04cl34k\"}}</p><p>In 1977, a team led by Jack Corliss of Oregon State University took a submersible 1.5 miles (2.5km) down into the eastern Pacific Ocean. They were surveying the Gal&aacute;pagos hotspot, where tall ridges of rock rise from the sea floor. The ridges, they knew, were volcanically active.</p><blockquote><p> Each vent was a kind of primordial soup dispenser </p></blockquote><p>Corliss found that the ridges were pockmarked with, essentially, hot springs. Hot, chemical-rich water was welling up from below the sea floor and <a href=\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1126/science.203.4385.1073\">pumping out through holes in the rocks</a>.</p><p>Astonishingly, these \"hydrothermal vents\" were densely populated by strange animals. There were huge clams, limpets, mussels, and tubeworms. The water was also thick with bacteria. All these organisms lived on the energy from the hydrothermal vents.</p><p>The discovery of hydrothermal vents made Corliss's name. It also got him thinking. In 1981 he proposed that similar vents existed on Earth four billion years ago, and that <a href=\"http://archimer.ifremer.fr/doc/00245/35661/\">they were the site of the origin of life</a>. He would spend much of the rest of his career working on this idea.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p04cl3fw\"}}</p><p>Corliss proposed that hydrothermal vents could create cocktails of chemicals. Each vent, he said, was a kind of primordial soup dispenser.</p><blockquote><p> Key compounds like sugars \"would survive&hellip; for seconds at most\" </p></blockquote><p>As hot water flowed up through the rocks, the heat and pressure caused simple organic compounds to fuse into more complex ones like amino acids, nucleotides and sugars. Closer to the boundary with the ocean, where the water was not quite as hot, they began linking into chains &ndash; forming carbohydrates, proteins, and nucleotides like DNA. Then, as the water approached the ocean and cooled still further, these molecules assembled into simple cells.</p><p>It was neat, and <a href=\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF01808177\">caught people's attention</a>. But Stanley Miller, whose seminal origin-of-life experiment we discussed in Chapter One, was not convinced. <a href=\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/334609a0\">Writing in 1988</a>, he argued the vents were too hot.</p><p>While extreme heat would trigger the formation of chemicals like amino acids, Miller's experiments suggested that it would also destroy them. Key compounds like sugars \"would survive&hellip; for seconds at most\". What's more, these simple molecules would be unlikely to link up into chains, because the surrounding water would break the chains almost immediately.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p04cl2cv\"}}</p><p>At this point the geologist <a href=\"https://science.jpl.nasa.gov/people/Russell/\">Mike Russell</a> stepped into the fray. He thought that the vent theory <a href=\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/336117a0\">could be made to work after all</a>. What's more, it seemed to him that the vents were the ideal home for W&auml;chtersh&auml;user's precursor organisms. This inspiration would lead him to create one of the most widely-accepted theories of the origin of life.</p><blockquote><p> If Russell was correct, life began at the bottom of the sea </p></blockquote><p>Russell had spent his early life variously making aspirin, scouting for valuable minerals and &ndash; <a href=\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/459316a\">in one remarkable incident in the 1960s</a> &ndash; coordinating the response to a possible volcanic eruption, despite having no training. But his real interest was in how Earth's surface has changed over the eons. This geological perspective has shaped <a href=\"https://aeon.co/essays/why-life-is-not-a-thing-but-a-restless-manner-of-being\">his ideas on the origin of life</a>.</p><p>In the 1980s he found fossil evidence of a less extreme kind of hydrothermal vent, where the temperatures were below 150C. These milder temperatures, he argued, would allow the molecules of life to survive far longer than Miller had assumed they would.</p><p>What's more, the fossil remains of these cooler vents held something strange. A mineral called pyrite, which is made of iron and sulphur, had formed into tubes about 1mm across.</p><p>In his lab, Russell found that <a href=\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-3121.1989.tb00364.x\">the pyrite could also form spherical blobs</a>. He suggested that the first complex organic molecules formed inside these simple pyrite structures.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p04cl31d\"}}</p><p>Around this time, W&auml;chtersh&auml;user had begun publishing his ideas, which relied on a stream of hot chemical-rich water flowing over a mineral. He had even proposed that pyrite was involved.</p><blockquote><p> His idea relied on the work of one of modern science's forgotten geniuses </p></blockquote><p>So <a href=\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00160147\">Russell put two and two together</a>. He suggested that hydrothermal vents in the deep sea, tepid enough for the pyrite structures to form, hosted W&auml;chtersh&auml;user's precursor organisms. If Russell was correct, life began at the bottom of the sea &ndash; and metabolism appeared first.</p><p>Russell set all this out in <a href=\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-3121.1993.tb00267.x\">a paper published in 1993</a>, 40 years after Miller's classic experiment. It did not get the same excited media coverage, but it was arguably more important. Russell had combined two seemingly separate ideas &ndash; W&auml;chtersh&auml;user's metabolic cycles and Corliss's hydrothermal vents &ndash; into something truly convincing.</p><p>Just to make it even more impressive, Russell also offered an explanation for how the first organisms obtained their energy. In other words, he figured out how their metabolism could have worked. His idea relied on the work of one of modern science's forgotten geniuses.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p04clbq6\"}}</p><p>In the 1960s, the biochemist <a href=\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1098/rsbm.1994.0040\">Peter Mitchell</a> fell ill and was forced to resign from the University of Edinburgh. Instead, he set up a private lab in a remote manor house in Cornwall. Isolated from the scientific community, <a href=\"https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg20427306-200-was-our-oldest-ancestor-a-proton-powered-rock/\">his work was partly funded by a herd of dairy cows</a>. Many biochemists, <a href=\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/46903\">including, initially, Leslie Orgel</a>, whose work on RNA we discussed in Chapter Two, thought that his ideas were utterly ridiculous.</p><blockquote><p> We now know that the process Mitchell identified is used by every living thing on Earth </p></blockquote><p>Less than two decades later, Mitchell achieved the ultimate victory: <a href=\"http://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/chemistry/laureates/1978/\">the 1978 Nobel Prize in Chemistry</a>. He has never been a household name, but his ideas are in every biology textbook.</p><p>Mitchell spent his career figuring out what organisms do with the energy they get from food. In effect, he was asking how we all stay alive from moment to moment.</p><p>He knew that all cells store their energy in the same molecule: adenosine triphosphate (ATP). The crucial bit is a chain of three phosphates, anchored to the adenosine. Adding the third phosphate takes a lot of energy, which is then locked up in the ATP.</p><p>When a cell needs energy &ndash; say, if a muscle needs to contract &ndash; it breaks the third phosphate off an ATP. This turns it into adenosine diphosphate (ADP) and releases the stored energy.</p><blockquote><p> He has never been a household name </p></blockquote><p>Mitchell wanted to know how the cells made the ATP in the first place. How did they concentrate enough energy onto an ADP, so that the third phosphate would attach?</p><p>Mitchell knew that the enzyme that makes ATP sits on a membrane. So he suggested that the cell was pumping charged particles called protons across the membrane, so that there were lots of protons on one side and hardly any on the other.</p><p>The protons would then try to flow back across the membrane to balance out the number of protons on each side &ndash; but the only place they could get through was the enzyme. The stream of protons passing through gave the enzyme the energy it needed to make ATP.</p><p>See how cells harness energy in this video:</p><p>{\"video\":{ \"pid\": \"p04d76cr\",\"encoding\": \"ib2\" }}</p><p><a href=\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/191144a0\">Mitchell first set out this idea in 1961</a>. He spent the next 15 years <a href=\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/213137a0\">defending it from all comers</a>, until the evidence became irrefutable. We now know that the process Mitchell identified is used by every living thing on Earth. It is happening inside your cells right now. Like DNA, it is fundamental to life as we know it.</p><blockquote><p> Corliss's vents would not do </p></blockquote><p>The key point that Russell picked up on is Mitchell's proton gradient: having lots of protons on one side of a membrane, and few on the other. All cells need a proton gradient to store energy.</p><p>Modern cells create the gradients by pumping protons across a membrane, but this involves complex molecular machinery that cannot have just popped into existence. So Russell made one more logical leap: life must have formed somewhere with a natural proton gradient.</p><p>Somewhere like a hydrothermal vent. But it would have to be a specific type of vent. When Earth was young the seas were acidic, and acidic water has a lot of protons floating around inside it. To create a proton gradient, the water from the vent must have been low in protons: <a href=\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF01582037\">it must have been alkaline</a>.</p><p>Corliss's vents would not do. Not only were they too hot, they were acidic. But in 2000, <a href=\"http://www.ocean.washington.edu/home/Deborah+Kelley\">Deborah Kelley</a> of the University of Washington discovered the first alkaline vents.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p04cl45r\"}}</p><p>Kelley had to battle just to become a scientist in the first place. Her father died as she was finishing high school, and <a href=\"http://oceanexplorer.noaa.gov/edu/oceanage/05kelley/welcome.html\">she was forced to work long hours</a> to support herself through college.</p><blockquote><p> He became convinced that vents like those of Lost City were where life began </p></blockquote><p>But she succeeded, and became fascinated both by undersea volcanoes and the searing hot hydrothermal vents. Those twin loves eventually led her to the middle of the Atlantic Ocean. There, <a href=\"http://www.bbc.com/earth/bespoke/story/the-cracks-ripping-earth-apart/index.html\">Earth's crust is being pulled apart</a> and a ridge of mountains rises from the sea floor.</p><p>On this ridge, Kelley found <a href=\"http://www.ocean.washington.edu/home/Deborah+Kelley\">a field of hydrothermal vents</a> that she called \"Lost City\". They are not like the ones Corliss found. The water flowing from them is only 40-75C, and mildly alkaline. Carbonate minerals from this water have clumped into steep, white \"chimneys\" that rise from the sea bed like organ pipes. Their appearance is eerie and ghost-like, but this is misleading: they are home to dense communities of microorganisms that thrive on the vent water.</p><p>These alkaline vents were the perfect fit for Russell's ideas. He became convinced that vents like those of Lost City were where life began.</p><p>But he had a problem. Being a geologist, he did not know enough about biological cells to make his theory truly convincing.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p04cl3y4\"}}</p><p>So Russell teamed up with biologist <a href=\"http://www.molevol.hhu.de/en/prof-dr-w-f-martin.html\">William Martin</a>, a pugnacious American who has spent most of his career in Germany. In 2003 the pair set out <a href=\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1098/rstb.2002.1183\">an improved version of Russell's earlier ideas</a>. It is arguably the most fleshed-out story of how life began.</p><blockquote><p> This story is now regarded as one of the leading hypotheses for the origin of life </p></blockquote><p>Thanks to Kelley, they now knew that the rocks of alkaline vents were porous: they were pocked with tiny holes filled with water. These little pockets, they suggested, acted as \"cells\". Each pocket contained essential chemicals, including minerals like pyrite. Combined with the natural proton gradient from the vent, they were the ideal place for metabolism to begin.</p><p>Once life had harnessed the chemical energy of the vent water, Russell and Martin say, it started making molecules like RNA. Eventually it created its own membrane and became a true cell, and escaped from the porous rock into the open water.</p><p>This story is now regarded as one of the leading hypotheses for the origin of life.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p04clc5r\"}}</p><p>It found powerful support in July 2016, when Martin published <a href=\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/nmicrobiol.2016.116\">a study</a> reconstructing some of the features of the \"last universal common ancestor\" (LUCA). This is the organism that lived billions of years ago and from which all existing life is descended.</p><blockquote><p> RNA World supporters say the vent theory has two problems </p></blockquote><p>We will probably never find direct fossil evidence of LUCA, but we can still make an educated guess as to how it might have looked and behaved by looking at microorganisms that do survive today. This is what Martin did.</p><p>He examined the DNA of 1,930 modern microorganisms, and identified 355 genes that almost all of them had. This is arguably evidence that these 355 genes have been passed down, from generation to generation, ever since those 1,930 microbes shared a common ancestor &ndash; roughly at the time that LUCA was alive.</p><p>The 355 genes included some for harnessing a proton gradient, but not genes for generating one &ndash; exactly as Russell and Martin's theories would predict. What's more, LUCA seems to have been adapted to the presence of chemicals like methane, which suggests it inhabited a volcanically-active environment &ndash; like a vent.</p><p>Despite this, RNA World supporters say the vent theory has two problems. One could potentially be fixed: the other might be fatal.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p04cl2q9\"}}</p><p>The first problem is that there is no experimental evidence for the processes Russell and Martin describe. They have a step-by-step story, but none of the steps have been seen in a lab.</p><p>\"The people who think replication was first, they continuously provide new experimental data,\" says origin-of-life expert Armen Mulkidjanian. \"The people who favour metabolism-first do not.\"</p><blockquote><p> The chemistry of all these molecules is incompatible with water </p></blockquote><p>That could change, thanks to Martin's colleague <a href=\"http://www.nick-lane.net/\">Nick Lane</a> of University College London. He has built an \"<a href=\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00239-014-9658-4\">origin of life reactor</a>\", which will simulate the conditions inside an alkaline vent. He hopes to observe metabolic cycles, and perhaps even molecules like RNA. But it is early days.</p><p>The second problem is the vents' location in the deep sea. As Miller pointed out in 1988, long-chain molecules like RNA and proteins cannot form in water without enzymes to help them.</p><p>For many researchers, this is a knock-down argument. \"If you have a background in chemistry, you cannot buy the idea of deep-sea vents, because you know the chemistry of all these molecules is incompatible with water,\" says Mulkidjanian.</p><p>Regardless, Russell and his allies remain bullish.</p><p>But in the last decade, a third approach has come to the fore, bolstered by a series of extraordinary experiments. This promises something that neither the RNA World nor the hydrothermal vents have so far managed: a way to make an entire cell from scratch.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p04cl3qr\"}}</p><p><strong>Chapter 5. How to make a cell</strong></p><p><em>By the early 2000s, there were two leading ideas about how life could have begun. Supporters of the \"RNA World\" were convinced that life began with a self-replicating molecule. Meanwhile, scientists in the \"metabolism-first\" camp had developed a detailed narrative about how life could have begun in hydrothermal vents in the deep sea. However, a third idea was about to come to the fore.</em></p><p>Every living thing on Earth is made of cells. Each cell is basically a squishy ball, with a tough outer wall or \"membrane\".</p><p>The point of a cell is <a href=\"http://wsimag.com/science-and-technology/20118-why-is-life-cellular\">to keep all the essentials of life together</a>. If the outer wall gets torn open, the guts spill out and the cell dies &ndash; just as a person who has been disembowelled generally does not have long to live.</p><blockquote><p> In the heat and tempest of the early Earth, a few raw materials must have assembled into crude cells </p></blockquote><p>The outer wall of the cell is so essential, some origin-of-life researchers argue that it must have been the first thing that emerged. They think that the \"genetics first\" efforts discussed in Chapter Three and the \"metabolism first\" ideas discussed in Chapter Four are misguided. Their alternative &ndash; \"compartmentalisation-first\" &ndash; has its champion in <a href=\"http://www.plluisi.org/\">Pier Luigi Luisi</a> of Roma Tre University in Rome, Italy.</p><p>Luisi's reasoning is simple and hard to argue with. How could you possibly set up a working metabolism or a self-replicating RNA, each of which relies on having a lot of chemicals in one place, unless you first have a container to keep all the molecules in?</p><p>If you accept this, there is only one way life could have begun. Somehow, in the heat and tempest of the early Earth, a few raw materials must have assembled into crude cells, or \"protocells\". The challenge is to make this happen in a lab: to create a simple living cell.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p04cl2p6\"}}</p><p>Luisi can trace his ideas all the way back to Alexander Oparin and the dawn of origin-of-life science in the USSR &ndash; discussed in Chapter One. Oparin highlighted the fact that certain chemicals form into blobs called coacervates, which can hold other substances in their cores. He suggested that these coacervates were the first protocells.</p><blockquote><p> The challenge was to make the protocells out of just the right stuff </p></blockquote><p>Any fatty or oily substance will form blobs or films in water. These chemicals are collectively known as lipids, and the idea that they formed the first life has been called the \"<a href=\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1023/A:1006746807104\">Lipid World</a>\".</p><p>But just forming blobs is not enough. The blobs need to be stable, they need to be able to divide to form \"daughter\" blobs, and they need at least some control over what travels in and out of them &ndash; all without the elaborate proteins that modern cells use to achieve these things.</p><p>The challenge was to make the protocells out of just the right stuff. Despite trying many substances over the decades, Luisi has never made anything lifelike enough to be convincing.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p04cl321\"}}</p><p>Then in 1994, Luisi made a daring suggestion. He proposed that <a href=\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/bbpc.19940980918\">the first protocells must have contained RNA</a>. What's more, this RNA must have been able to replicate inside the protocell.</p><blockquote><p> We would meet at origins meetings and get into these long arguments </p></blockquote><p>It was a big ask, and it meant abandoning the pure compartmentalisation-first approach. But Luisi had good reasons.</p><p>A cell with an outer wall, but no genes inside it, could not do anything much. It might be able to divide into daughter cells, but it could not pass on any information about itself to its offspring. It could only start evolving and becoming more complex if it contained some genes.</p><p>This idea would soon gain a crucial supporter in Jack Szostak, whose work on the RNA World hypothesis we explored in Chapter Three. While Luisi was a member of the compartmentalisation-first camp, Szostak supported genetics-first, so for many years they had not seen eye-to-eye.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p04cl3lv\"}}</p><p>\"We would meet at origins meetings and get into these long arguments about which was more important and which came first,\" recalls Szostak. \"Eventually, we realised that cells have both. We came to a consensus that for the origin of life, it was critical to have both compartmentalisation and a genetic system.\"</p><blockquote><p> Szostak and two colleagues announced a major success </p></blockquote><p>In 2001, <a href=\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/35053176\">Szostak and Luisi set out their case for this more unified approach</a>. Writing in <em>Nature</em>, they argued that it should be possible to make simple living cells from scratch, by hosting replicating RNAs in a simple, fatty blob.</p><p>It was a dramatic idea, and Szostak soon decided to put his money where his mouth was. Reasoning that \"we can't put out that theory without anything backing it up\", he decided to start experimenting with protocells.</p><p>Two years later, Szostak and two colleagues announced a major success.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p04cl3dg\"}}</p><p>They had been experimenting with vesicles: spherical blobs, with two layers of fatty acids on the outside and a central core of liquid.</p><blockquote><p> Montmorillonite, and clays like it, could be important in the origin of life </p></blockquote><p>Trying to find a way to speed up the creation of the vesicles, they added small particles of a kind of clay called montmorillonite.</p><p>This made the vesicles form 100 times faster. The surface of the clay acted as a catalyst, just like an enzyme would.</p><p>What's more, the vesicles could absorb both montmorillonite particles and RNA strands from the clay surface. <a href=\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1126/science.1089904\">These protocells now contained genes and a catalyst</a>, all from one simple setup.</p><p>The decision to add montmorillonite was not done on a whim. Several decades of work had suggested that montmorillonite, <a href=\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF01732066\">and clays like it</a>, could be <a href=\"http://www.bbc.com/earth/story/20160823-the-idea-that-life-began-as-clay-crystals-is-50-years-old\">important in the origin of life</a>.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p04clbsv\"}}</p><p>Montmorillonite is a common clay. Nowadays it is used for all sorts of things, including making cat litter. It forms when volcanic ash is broken down by the weather. Since the early Earth had lots of volcanoes, it seems likely that montmorillonite was abundant.</p><p>Back in 1986, chemist <a href=\"https://www.rpi.edu/dept/chem/chem_faculty/profiles/ferris.html\">James Ferris</a> had shown that <a href=\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF02422142\">montmorillonite is a catalyst that helps organic molecules form</a>. He later found that <a href=\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1098/rstb.2006.1903\">it also accelerates the formation of small RNAs</a>.</p><p>This had led Ferris to speculate that this ordinary-looking clay was the site of the origin of life. Szostak took that idea and ran with it, using montmorillonite to help build his protocells.</p><blockquote><p> If the protocells could grow, maybe they could also divide </p></blockquote><p>One year later, Szostak's team found that their protocells could grow of their own accord.</p><p>As ever more RNA molecules were packed into a protocell, the outer wall came under increasing tension. It was as if the protocell had a full stomach and might go pop.</p><p>To compensate, the protocell picked up more fatty acids and incorporated them into its wall, allowing it to swell to a larger size and releasing the tension.</p><p>Crucially, it took the fatty acids from other protocells that contained less RNA, causing them to shrink. This meant the protocells were competing, and <a href=\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1126/science.1100757\">the ones with more RNA were winning</a>.</p><p>This suggested something even more impressive. If the protocells could grow, maybe they could also divide. Could Szostak's protocells reproduce themselves?</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p04cl4mk\"}}</p><p>Szostak's first experiments had shown a way to make protocells divide. Squeezing them through small holes stretched them out into tubes, which then broke into \"daughter\" protocells.</p><blockquote><p> The protocells grew and changed shape, elongating into long, rope-like strands </p></blockquote><p>This was neat, because no cellular machinery was involved: just the application of pressure. But it was not a great solution, because the protocells lost some of their contents in the process. It also implied that the first cells could only divide if they were pushed through tiny holes.</p><p>There are <a href=\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cbpa.2004.10.002\">lots of ways</a> to make vesicles divide: for example, adding a strong water current that creates a shearing force. The trick was to make the protocells divide without spilling their guts.</p><p>In 2009, Szostak and his student Ting Zhu found a solution. They made slightly more complex protocells, with several concentric outer walls a bit like the layers of an onion. Despite their intricacy, these protocells were still easy to make.</p><p>As Zhu fed them with ever more fatty acids, the protocells grew and changed shape, elongating into long, rope-like strands. Once a protocell was long enough, a gentle shearing force was enough <a href=\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/ja900919c\">to make it shatter into dozens of small daughter protocells</a>.</p><p>{\"video\":{ \"pid\": \"p04dfzcb\",\"encoding\": \"ib2\" }}</p><p>Each daughter protocell contained RNAs from the parent protocell, and hardly any of the RNA was lost. What's more, the protocells could perform the cycle repeatedly, with daughter protocells growing and then dividing themselves.</p><p>In later experiments, Zhu and Szostak have found <a href=\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1203212109\">even more ways to persuade the protocells to divide</a>. This aspect of the problem, at least, seems to be solved.</p><p>However, the protocells were still not doing enough. Luisi had wanted the protocells to host replicating RNA, but so far the RNA was simply sitting in them doing nothing.</p><blockquote><p> There were valuable clues buried in those dusty papers </p></blockquote><p>To really show that his protocells could have been the first life on Earth, Szostak needed to persuade the RNA inside them to replicate itself.</p><p>That was not going to be easy, because despite decades of trying &ndash; outlined in Chapter Three &ndash; nobody had managed to make an RNA that could self-replicate. That was the very problem that had stymied Szostak in his early work on the RNA World, and which nobody else had managed to solve.</p><p>So he went back and re-read the work of Leslie Orgel, who had spent so long working on the RNA World hypothesis. There were valuable clues buried in those dusty papers.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p04dbns5\"}}</p><p>Orgel had spent much the 1970s and 1980s studying how RNA strands get copied.</p><blockquote><p> This could have been how the first life made copies of its genes </p></blockquote><p>In essence it is simple. Take a single strand of RNA and a pool of loose nucleotides. Then, use those nucleotides to assemble a second strand of RNA that is complementary to the first one.</p><p>For example, a strand of RNA that reads \"CGC\" will produce a complementary strand that reads \"GCG\". If you do this twice, you will get a copy of the original \"CGC\", just in a roundabout way.</p><p>Orgel found that, under certain circumstances, RNA strands could copy in this way without any help from enzymes. This could have been how the first life made copies of its genes.</p><p>By 1987, Orgel could take an RNA strand 14 nucleotides long and <a href=\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0022-2836(87)90117-3\">create complementary strands that were also 14 nucleotides long</a>. He did not manage anything longer, but <a href=\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/1759-2208-3-2\">that was enough to intrigue Szostak</a>. His student Katarzyna Adamala tried to get this reaction going in the protocells.</p><blockquote><p> They have built protocells that hold onto their genes while taking in useful molecules from outside </p></blockquote><p>They found that the reaction needed magnesium to work, which was a problem because the magnesium destroyed the protocells. But there was a simple solution: citrate, which is almost identical to the citric acid in lemons and oranges, and which is found in all living cells anyway.</p><p><a href=\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1126/science.1241888\">In a study published in 2013</a>, they added citrate and found that it latched onto the magnesium, protecting the protocells while allowing the template copying to continue.</p><p>In other words, they had achieved what Luisi had proposed in 1994. \"We started to do RNA replication chemistry inside these fatty acid vesicles,\" says Szostak.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p04cl9qx\"}}</p><p>In just over a decade of research, Szostak's team has accomplished something remarkable.</p><p>They have built protocells that hold onto their genes while taking in useful molecules from outside. The protocells can grow and divide, and even compete with each other. RNA can replicate inside them. By any measure, they are startlingly life-like.</p><blockquote><p> Szostak's approach went against 40 years of work on the origin of life </p></blockquote><p>They are also resilient. In 2008, Szostak's team found that <a href=\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.0805086105\">the protocells could survive being heated to 100C</a>, a temperature that would obliterate most modern cells. This boosted the case that the protocells were similar to the first life, which must have endured scalding heat from constant meteor impacts.</p><p>\"Szostak is doing great work,\" says Armen Mulkidjanian.</p><p>Yet on the face of it, Szostak's approach went against 40 years of work on the origin of life. Instead of focusing on \"replication-first\" or \"compartmentalisation-first\", he found ways to get both to happen pretty much simultaneously.</p><p>That would inspire a new unified approach to the origin of life, which attempts to jumpstart all the functions of life at once. This \"everything-first\" idea has already accumulated a wealth of evidence, and could potentially solve all the problems with the existing ideas.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p04cl3sr\"}}</p><p><strong>Chapter 6. The great unification</strong></p><p><em>Throughout the second half of the 20th Century, origin-of-life researchers have worked in tribes. Each group favoured their own narrative and, for the most part, rubbished competing hypotheses. This approach has certainly been successful, as evidenced by the previous chapters, but every promising idea for the origin of life has ultimately come up against a major problem. So a few researchers are now trying a more unified approach.</em></p><p>This idea got its first big boost a few years ago from a result that, on the face of it, seemed to support the traditional, replication-first RNA World.</p><blockquote><p> All the key components of life could be formed at once </p></blockquote><p>By 2009, supporters of the RNA World had a big problem. They could not make nucleotides, the building blocks of RNA, in a way that could plausibly have happened on the early Earth. This, as we learned in Chapter Three, led people to suspect that the first life was not based on RNA at all.</p><p>John Sutherland had been thinking about this problem since the 1980s. \"I thought, if you could demonstrate that RNA could self-assemble that would be a cool thing to do,\" he says.</p><p>Fortunately for Sutherland, he had secured a job at the Laboratory of Molecular Biology (LMB) in Cambridge, UK. Most research institutions force their staff to constantly churn out new findings, but the LMB does not. So Sutherland could think about why it was so hard to make an RNA nucleotide, and to spend years developing an alternative approach.</p><p>His solution would lead him to propose a radical new idea about the origin of life, namely that all the key components of life could be formed at once.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p04cl350\"}}</p><p>\"There were certain key aspects of RNA chemistry that didn't work,\" says Sutherland. Each RNA nucleotide is made of a sugar, a base and a phosphate. But it had proved impossible to persuade the sugar and base to join up. The molecules were simply the wrong shape.</p><blockquote><p> He believes RNA was heavily involved, but it was not the be-all-and-end-all </p></blockquote><p>So Sutherland started trying totally different substances. Eventually his team homed in on five simple molecules, including a different sugar and cyanamide, which as the name suggests is related to cyanide. The team put these chemicals through <a href=\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/nature08013\">a series of reactions</a> that ultimately produced two of the four RNA nucleotides, without ever making standalone sugars or bases.</p><p>It was a slam-dunk success, and it made Sutherland's name.</p><p>Many observers interpreted the findings as <a href=\"https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg21128251-300-first-life-the-search-for-the-first-replicator\">further evidence for the RNA World</a>. But Sutherland himself does not see it like that at all.</p><p>The \"classic\" RNA World hypothesis says that, in the first organisms, RNA was responsible for all the functions of life. But Sutherland says that is \"hopelessly optimistic\". He believes RNA was heavily involved, but it was not the be-all-and-end-all.</p><blockquote><p> The molecules were simply the wrong shape </p></blockquote><p>Instead, he takes inspiration from the recent work of Jack Szostak, which &ndash; as discussed in Chapter Five &ndash; combines the \"replication-first\" RNA World with Pier Luigi Luisi's \"compartmentalisation-first\" ideas.</p><p>But Sutherland goes further. His approach is \"everything-first\". He aims to make an entire cell assemble itself, from scratch.</p><p>His first clue was an odd detail about his nucleotide synthesis, which at first seemed incidental.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p04dbrhv\"}}</p><p>The last step in Sutherland's process was to bolt a phosphate onto the nucleotide. But he found that it was best to include the phosphate in the mix right from the start, because it accelerated the earlier reactions.</p><p>On the face of it, including the phosphate before it was strictly needed was a messy thing to do, but Sutherland found that this messiness was a good thing.</p><blockquote><p> Get the mixture just complicated enough and all the components of life might form at once </p></blockquote><p>This led him to think about how messy his mixtures should be. On the early Earth, there must have been dozens or hundreds of chemicals all floating around together. That sounds like a recipe for a sludge, but maybe there was an optimum level of mess.</p><p>The mixtures Stanley Miller made back in the 1950s, which we looked at in Chapter One, were far messier than Sutherland's. They did contain biological molecules, but Sutherland says they \"were in trace amounts and they were accompanied by a vast number of other compounds, which are not biological\".</p><p>For Sutherland, this meant that Miller's setup was not good enough. It was too messy, so the good chemicals got lost in the mixture.</p><p>So Sutherland has set out to find a \"Goldilocks chemistry\": one that is not so messy that it becomes useless, but also not so simple that it is limited in what it can do. Get the mixture just complicated enough and all the components of life might form at once, then come together.</p><p>In other words, four billion years ago there was a pond on the Earth. It sat there for years until the mix of chemicals was just right. Then, perhaps within minutes, the first cell came into existence.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p04cl2h7\"}}</p><p>This may sound implausible, like the claims of medieval alchemists. But Sutherland's evidence is mounting. Since 2009, he has shown that the same chemistry that made his two RNA nucleotides can also make many of the other molecules of life.</p><blockquote><p> Our entire approach to the origin of life for the last 40 years has been wrong </p></blockquote><p>The obvious next step was to make more RNA nucleotides. He has not yet managed this, but in 2010 <a href=\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/ja108197s\">he made closely-related molecules</a> that could potentially transform into the nucleotides.</p><p>Similarly, in 2013 he made the precursors of amino acids. This time <a href=\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/anie.201300321\">he needed to add copper cyanide</a> to make the reactions go.</p><p>Cyanide-related chemicals were proving to be a common theme, and in 2015 Sutherland took them even further. He showed that the same pot of chemicals could also produce <a href=\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/nchem.2202\">the precursors of lipids</a>, the molecules that make up cell walls. The reactions were all driven by ultraviolet light, involved sulphur, and relied on copper to speed them up.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p04cl9tp\"}}</p><p>\"All the building blocks [emerge] from a common core of chemical reactions,\" says Szostak.</p><blockquote><p> The experiments were too clean </p></blockquote><p>If Sutherland is right, then our entire approach to the origin of life for the last 40 years has been wrong. Ever since the sheer complexity of the cell became clear, scientists have been working on the assumption that the first cells must have been constructed gradually, one piece at a time.</p><p>Following Leslie Orgel's proposal that RNA came first, researchers have been \"trying to get one thing before another thing, and then have that invent the other\", says Sutherland. But he thinks the best way is to make everything at once.</p><p>\"What we've done is to challenge the idea that it's too complicated to make everything in one go,\" says Sutherland. \"You certainly could make the building blocks for all the systems at once.\"</p><p>Szostak now suspects that most attempts to make the molecules of life, and to assemble them into living cells, have failed for the same reason: the experiments were too clean.</p><blockquote><p> I've really come back to the idea that the first polymer was something pretty close to RNA </p></blockquote><p>The scientists used the handful of chemicals they were interested in, and left out all the other ones that were probably present on the early Earth. But Sutherland's work shows that, <a href=\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1098/rstb.2011.0140\">by adding a few more chemicals to the mix</a>, more complex phenomena can be created.</p><p>Szostak experienced this for himself in 2005, when he was trying to get his protocells to host an RNA enzyme. The enzyme needed magnesium, which destroyed the protocells' membranes.</p><p>The solution was a surprising one. Instead of making the vesicles out of one pure fatty acid, <a href=\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/ja051784p\">they made them from a mixture of two</a>. These new, impure vesicles could cope with the magnesium &ndash; and that meant they could play host to working RNA enzymes.</p><p>What's more, Szostak says the first genes might also have embraced messiness.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p04cl1yd\"}}</p><p>Modern organisms use pure DNA to carry their genes, but pure DNA probably did not exist at first. There would have been a mixture of RNA nucleotides and DNA nucleotides.</p><p>In 2012 Szostak showed that <a href=\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1107113108\">such a mixture could assemble into \"mosaic\" molecules</a> that looked and behaved pretty much like pure RNA. These jumbled RNA/DNA chains could even fold up neatly.</p><blockquote><p> There is one problem that neither Sutherland nor Szostak have found a solution for </p></blockquote><p>This suggested that it did not matter if the first organisms could not make pure RNA, or pure DNA. \"I've really come back to the idea that the first polymer was something pretty close to RNA, a messier version of RNA,\" says Szostak.</p><p>There might even be room for the alternatives to RNA that have been cooked up in labs, like the TNA and PNA we met in Chapter Three. We do not know if any of them ever existed on Earth, but if they did the first organisms may well have used them alongside RNA.</p><p>This was not an RNA World: it was a \"<a href=\"https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn21335-before-dna-before-rna-life-in-the-hodge-podge-world/\">Hodge-Podge World</a>\".</p><p>The lesson from these studies is that making the first cell might not have been as hard as it once seemed. Yes, cells are intricate machines. But it turns out that they still work, albeit not quite as well, when they are flung together slapdash from whatever is to hand.</p><p>Such clumsy cells might seem unlikely to survive on the early Earth. But they would not have had much competition, and there were no threatening predators, so in many respects life may have been easier then than it is now.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p04cl2mh\"}}</p><p>There is one problem that neither Sutherland nor Szostak have found a solution for, and it is a big one. The first organism must have had some form of metabolism. Right from the start, life had to <a href=\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1098/rsob.130156\">obtain energy</a> or it would have died.</p><blockquote><p> Life may have been easier then than it is now </p></blockquote><p>On that point, if on nothing else, Sutherland agrees with Mike Russell, Bill Martin and the other supporters of Chapter Four's metabolism-first theories. \"While the RNA guys were fighting with the metabolism guys, both sides had a point,\" says Sutherland.</p><p>\"The origins of metabolism have to be in there somehow,\" says Szostak. \"The source of chemical energy is going to be the big question.\"</p><p>Even if Martin and Russell are wrong about life beginning in deep-sea vents, many elements of their theory are almost certainly correct. One is the importance of metals for the birth of life.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p04cl3xj\"}}</p><p>In nature, many enzymes have a metal atom at their core. This is often the \"active\" part of the enzyme, with the rest of the molecule essentially a support structure. The first life cannot have had these complex enzymes, so instead it probably used \"naked\" metals as catalysts.</p><blockquote><p> Life cannot have begun in the deep sea </p></blockquote><p>G&uuml;nter W&auml;chtersh&auml;user made this point when he suggested that life formed on iron pyrite. Similarly, Russell emphasises that the waters of hydrothermal vents are rich in metals, which could act as catalysts &ndash; and Martin's study of LUCA found a lot of iron-based enzymes.</p><p>In light of this, it is telling that many of Sutherland's chemical reactions rely on copper (and, incidentally, on the sulphur that W&auml;chtersh&auml;user also emphasised), and that the RNA in Szostak's protocells needs magnesium.</p><p>It may yet be that hydrothermal vents will turn out to be crucial. \"If you look at modern metabolism, there's all these really suggestive things like iron-sulphur clusters,\" says Szostak. That fits the idea that life began in or around a vent, where the water is rich in iron and sulphur.</p><p>That said, if Sutherland and Szostak are on the right track, one aspect of the vent theory is definitely wrong: life cannot have begun in the deep sea.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p04cl2vh\"}}</p><p>\"The chemistry we've uncovered is so dependent on UV [ultraviolet light],\" says Sutherland. The only source of ultraviolet radiation is the Sun, so his reactions can only take place in sunny places. \"It rules out a deep-sea vent scenario.\"</p><blockquote><p> Maybe life began on land, in a volcanic pond </p></blockquote><p>Szostak agrees that the deep sea was not life's nursery. \"The worst thing is that it's isolated from atmospheric chemistry, which is the source of high-energy starting materials like cyanide.\"</p><p>But these problems do not rule out hydrothermal vents altogether. Perhaps the vents were simply in shallow water, where sunlight and cyanide could reach them.</p><p>Armen Mulkidjanian has suggested an alternative. Maybe life began on land, in a volcanic pond.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p04cl38z\"}}</p><p>Mulkidjanian looked at the chemical makeup of cells: specifically, which chemicals they allow in and which they keep out. It turns out that all cells, regardless of what organism they belong to, contain a lot of phosphate, potassium and other metals &ndash; but hardly any sodium.</p><blockquote><p> My favourite scenario at the moment would be some kind of shallow lakes or ponds on the surface </p></blockquote><p>Nowadays, cells achieve this by pumping things in and out, but the first cells cannot have done so because they would not have had the necessary machinery. So Mulkidjanian suggested that the first cells formed somewhere that had roughly the same mix of chemicals as modern cells.</p><p>That immediately eliminates the ocean. Cells contain far higher levels of potassium and phosphate than the ocean ever has, and far less sodium.</p><p>Instead, <a href=\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1117774109\">it points to the geothermal ponds found near active volcanoes</a>. These ponds have exactly the cocktail of metals found in cells.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p04cl4jb\"}}</p><p>Szostak is a fan. \"I think my favourite scenario at the moment would be some kind of shallow lakes or ponds on the surface, in a geothermally-active area,\" he says. \"You have hydrothermal vents but not like the deep-sea vents, more like the kind of vents we have in volcanic areas like Yellowstone.\"</p><blockquote><p> Earth was pounded by meteorites throughout its first half-billion years of existence </p></blockquote><p>Sutherland's chemistry might well work in such a place. The springs have the right chemicals, the water level fluctuates so some places will dry out at times, and there is plenty of ultraviolet radiation from the Sun.</p><p>What's more, Szostak says the ponds would be suitable for his protocells.</p><p>\"The protocells could be relatively cool most of the time, which is good for RNA copying and other kinds of simple metabolism,\" says Szostak. \"But every now and then they get heated up briefly, and that helps the strands of RNA come apart ready for the next round of replication.\" There would also be currents, driven by the streams of hot water, which could help the protocells divide.</p><p>Drawing on many of the same lines of argument, Sutherland has put forward a third option: a meteorite impact zone.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p04cl2l4\"}}</p><p>Earth was pounded by meteorites throughout its first half-billion years of existence &ndash; <a href=\"http://www.bbc.com/earth/story/20160415-what-really-happened-when-the-dino-killer-asteroid-struck\">and has been occasionally struck ever since</a>. A decent-sized impact would create a setup rather similar to Mulkidjanian's ponds.</p><p>First, meteorites are mostly made of metal. The impact zones tend to be rich in useful metals like iron, as well as sulphur. And crucially, meteorite impacts melt the Earth's crust, leading to geothermal activity and hot water.</p><blockquote><p> If it turns out that one of the scenarios is missing a key chemical, or contains something that destroys protocells, it will be ruled out </p></blockquote><p>Sutherland imagines small rivers and streams trickling down the slopes of an impact crater, leaching cyanide-based chemicals from the rocks while ultraviolet radiation pours down from above. Each stream would have a slightly different mix of chemicals, so different reactions would happen and a whole host of organic chemicals would be produced.</p><p>Finally the streams would flow into a volcanic pond at the bottom of the crater. It could have been in a pond like this that all the pieces came together and the first protocells formed.</p><p>\"That's a very specific scenario,\" says Sutherland. But he chose it on the basis of the chemical reactions he has found. \"It's the only one we can think of that's compatible with the chemistry.\"</p><p>Szostak is not sure either way, but he agrees that Sutherland's idea deserves careful attention. \"I think the impact scenario is nice. I think the idea of volcanic systems might also work. There's some arguments in favour of each.\"</p><p>For now that debate looks set to rumble on. But it will not be decided on a whim. The decision will be driven by the chemistry and the protocells. If it turns out that one of the scenarios is missing a key chemical, or contains something that destroys protocells, it will be ruled out.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p04cl96z\"}}</p><p>This means that, for the first time in history, we have the beginnings of a comprehensive explanation for how life began.</p><p>\"Things are looking a lot more achievable,\" says Sutherland.</p><blockquote><p> The best we can ever do is to draw up a story that is consistent with all the evidence </p></blockquote><p>So far, the \"everything-at-once\" approach of Szostak and Sutherland offers only a sketchy narrative. But those steps that have been worked out are supported by decades of experiments.</p><p>The idea also draws on every approach to the origin of life. It attempts to harness all their good points, while at the same time solving all their problems. For instance, it does not so much try to disprove Russell's ideas about hydrothermal vents, but rather to incorporate their best elements.</p><p>We cannot know for sure what happened four billion years ago. \"Even if you made a reactor and out pops <em>E. coli</em> on the other side&hellip; you still can't prove that we arose that way,\" says Martin.</p><p>The best we can ever do is to draw up a story that is consistent with all the evidence: with experiments in chemistry, with what we know about the early Earth, and with what biology reveals about the oldest forms of life. Finally, after a century of fractious effort, that story is coming into view.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p04cl437\"}}</p><p>That means we are approaching one of the great divides in human history: the divide between those who know the story of life's beginning, and those who never could.</p><blockquote><p> Some of the people alive today will become the first in history who can honestly say they know where they came from </p></blockquote><p>Every single person who died before Darwin published <em>Origin of Species</em> in 1859 was ignorant of humanity's origins, because they knew nothing of evolution. But everyone alive now, barring isolated groups, can know the truth about our kinship with other animals.</p><p>Similarly, everyone born after Yuri Gagarin orbited the Earth in 1961 has lived in a society that can travel to other worlds. Even if we never go ourselves, space travel is a reality.</p><p>These facts change our worldview in subtle ways. Arguably, they make us wiser. Evolution teaches us to treasure every other living thing, for they are our cousins. Space travel allows us <a href=\"http://www.bbc.com/earth/story/20151109-take-a-trip-around-the-pale-blue-dot-we-all-call-home\">to see our world from a distance</a>, revealing how unique and fragile it is.</p><p>Some of the people alive today will become the first in history who can honestly say they know where they came from. They will know what their ultimate ancestor was like and where it lived.</p><p>This knowledge will change us. On a purely scientific level, it will tell us about how likely life is to form in the Universe, and where to look for it. And it will tell us something about life's essential nature. But beyond that, we cannot yet know the wisdom the origin of life will reveal.</p><p><em>Join over five million BBC Earth fans by liking us on <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/bbcearth\" target=\"_blank\">Facebook</a>, or follow us on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/bbcearth\" target=\"_blank\">Twitter</a> and <a href=\"https://instagram.com/bbcearth/\" target=\"_blank\">Instagram</a>.</em></p><p><em>If you liked this story, <a href=\"http://pages.emails.bbc.com/subscribe/?ocid=ear.bbc.email.we.email-signup\" target=\"_blank\">sign up for the weekly bbc.com features newsletter</a> called \"If You Only Read 6 Things This Week\".

What about me?</p><p>These used to be questions that only philosophers worried about. Scientists just got on with figuring out how the world is, and why. But some of the current best guesses about how the world is seem to leave the question hanging over science too.</p><p>Several physicists, cosmologists and technologists are now happy to entertain the idea that we are all living inside a gigantic computer simulation, experiencing a <em>Matrix</em>-style virtual world that we mistakenly think is real.</p><p>Our instincts rebel, of course. It all feels too real to be a simulation. The weight of the cup in my hand, the rich aroma of the coffee it contains, the sounds all around me &ndash; how can such richness of experience be faked?</p><p>But then consider the extraordinary progress in computer and information technologies over the past few decades. Computers have given us games of uncanny realism &ndash; with autonomous characters responding to our choices &ndash; as well as virtual-reality simulators of tremendous persuasive power.</p><p>It is enough to make you paranoid.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0133093/\"><em>The Matrix</em></a> formulated the narrative with unprecedented clarity. In that story, humans are locked by a malignant power into a virtual world that they accept unquestioningly as \"real\". But the science-fiction nightmare of being trapped in a universe manufactured within our minds can be traced back further, for instance to David Cronenberg's <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0086541/\"><em>Videodrome</em></a> (1983) and Terry Gilliam's <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0088846/\"><em>Brazil</em></a> (1985).</p><p>Over all these dystopian visions, there loom two questions. How would we know? And would it matter anyway?</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p046h7gr\"}}</p><p>The idea that we live in a simulation has some high-profile advocates.</p><p>In June 2016, technology entrepreneur Elon Musk <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/jun/02/elon-musk-tesla-space-x-paypal-hyperloop-simulation\">asserted</a> that the odds are \"a billion to one\" against us living in \"base reality\".</p><p>Similarly, Google's machine-intelligence guru Ray Kurzweil has suggested that \"maybe our whole universe is a science experiment of some junior high-school student in another universe\".</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p04f2kr9\"}}</p><p>What's more, some physicists are willing to entertain the possibility. In April 2016, several of them <a href=\"http://www.space.com/32543-universe-a-simulation-asimov-debate.html\">debated the issue</a> at the American Museum of Natural History in New York, US.</p><blockquote><p> There is nothing in principle that rules out the possibility of manufacturing a universe in an artificial Big Bang </p></blockquote><p>None of these people are proposing that we are physical beings held in some gloopy vat and wired up to believe in the world around us, as in <em>The Matrix</em>.</p><p>Instead, there are at least two other ways that the Universe around us might not be the real one.</p><p>Cosmologist <a href=\"http://web.mit.edu/physics/people/faculty/guth_alan.html\">Alan Guth</a> of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, US has <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZtRfACbygY\">suggested</a> that our entire Universe might be real yet still a kind of lab experiment. The idea is that our Universe was created by some super-intelligence, much as biologists breed colonies of micro-organisms.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p04f2kr9\"}}</p><p>There is nothing in principle that rules out the possibility of <a href=\"http://www.bbc.com/earth/story/20150602-how-will-the-universe-end\">manufacturing a universe in an artificial Big Bang</a>, filled with real matter and energy, says Guth.</p><blockquote><p> Musk and other like-minded folk are suggesting that we are entirely simulated beings </p></blockquote><p>Nor would it destroy the universe in which it was made. The new universe would create its own bubble of space-time, separate from that in which it was hatched. This bubble would quickly pinch off from the parent universe and lose contact with it.</p><p>This scenario does not then really change anything. Our Universe might have been born in some super-beings' equivalent of a test tube, but it is just as physically \"real\" as if it had been born \"naturally\".</p><p>However, there is a second scenario. It is this one that has garnered all the attention, because it seems to undermine our very concept of reality.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p046h7b0\"}}</p><p>Musk and other like-minded folk are suggesting that we are entirely simulated beings. We could be nothing more than strings of information manipulated in some gigantic computer, like the characters in a video game.</p><blockquote><p> We can simulate human societies using rather simple \"agents\" that make choices according to certain rules </p></blockquote><p>Even our brains are simulated, and are responding to simulated sensory inputs.</p><p>In this view, there is no Matrix to \"escape from\". This is where we live, and is our only chance of \"living\" at all.</p><p>But why believe in such a baroque possibility? The argument is quite simple: we already make simulations, and with better technology it should be possible to create the ultimate one, with conscious agents that experience it as totally lifelike.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p046h7tn\"}}</p><p>We carry out computer simulations not just in games but in research. Scientists try to simulate aspects of the world at levels ranging from the subatomic to entire societies or galaxies, even whole universes.</p><blockquote><p> Who is to say that before long we will not be able to create computational agents &ndash; virtual beings &ndash; that show signs of consciousness? </p></blockquote><p>For example, computer simulations of animals may tell us how they develop complex behaviours like flocking and swarming. Other simulations help us understand how planets, stars and galaxies form.</p><p>We can also simulate human societies using rather simple \"agents\" that make choices according to certain rules. These give us insights into how cooperation appears, how cities evolve, how road traffic and economies function, and much else.</p><p>These simulations are getting ever more complex as computer power expands. Already, some simulations of human behaviour try to build in rough descriptions of cognition. Researchers envisage a time, not far away, when these agents' decision-making will not come from simple \"if&hellip;then&hellip;\" rules. Instead, they will give the agents simplified models of the brain and see how they respond.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p046h62z\"}}</p><p>Who is to say that before long we will not be able to create computational agents &ndash; virtual beings &ndash; that show signs of consciousness?

They will vastly outnumber the one \"real\" world around us.</p><p>Is it not likely, then, that some other intelligence elsewhere in the Universe has already reached that point?</p><p>If so, it makes sense for any conscious beings like ourselves to assume that we are actually in such a simulation, and not in the one world from which the virtual realities are run. The probability is just so much greater.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p046h6zf\"}}</p><p>Philosopher <a href=\"http://www.nickbostrom.com/\">Nick Bostrom</a> of the University of Oxford in the UK <a href=\"http://www.simulation-argument.com/\">has broken down this scenario into three possibilities</a>. As he puts it, either:</p><p>(1) Intelligent civilisations never get to the stage where they can make such simulations, perhaps because they wipe themselves out first; or</p><p>(2) They get to that point, but then choose for some reason not to conduct such simulations; or</p><p>(3) We are overwhelmingly likely to be in such a simulation.</p><p>The question is which of these options seems most probable.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p046h624\"}}</p><p>Astrophysicist and Nobel laureate <a href=\"http://aether.lbl.gov/personnel/smoot.html\">George Smoot</a> has <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Chfoo9NBEow\">argued</a> that there is no compelling reason to believe (1) or (2).</p><blockquote><p> The best way would be to search for flaws in the program </p></blockquote><p>Sure, humanity is causing itself plenty of problems at the moment, what with <a href=\"http://www.bbc.com/earth/story/20151130-how-hot-could-the-earth-get\">climate change</a>, nuclear weapons and a looming <a href=\"http://www.bbc.com/earth/story/20150715-why-save-an-endangered-species\">mass extinction</a>. But these problems need not be terminal.</p><p>What's more, there is nothing to suggest that truly detailed simulations, in which the agents experience themselves as real and free, are impossible in principle. Smoot adds that, given how widespread we now know other planets to be (<a href=\"http://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-37167390\">with another Earth-like one right on our cosmic doorstep</a>), it would be the height of arrogance to assume that we are the most advanced intelligence in the entire Universe.</p><p>What about option (2)? Conceivably, we might desist from making such simulations for ethical reasons. Perhaps it would seem improper to create simulated beings that believe they exist and have autonomy.</p><p>But that too seems unlikely, Smoot says. After all, one key reason we conduct simulations today is to find out more about the real world. This can help us make the world better and save lives. So there are sound ethical reasons for doing it.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p04f2kr9\"}}</p><p>That seems to leave us with option (3): we are probably in a simulation.</p><blockquote><p> Some scientists argue that there are already good reasons to think we are inside a simulation </p></blockquote><p>But this is all just supposition. Could we find any evidence?</p><p>Many researchers believe that depends on how good the simulation is. The best way would be to search for flaws in the program, just like the glitches that betray the artificial nature of the \"ordinary world\" in <em>The Matrix</em>. For instance, we might discover inconsistencies in the laws of physics.</p><p>Alternatively, the late artificial-intelligence maven <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/01/26/business/marvin-minsky-pioneer-in-artificial-intelligence-dies-at-88.html\">Marvin Minsky</a> has suggested that there might be giveaway errors due to \"rounding off\" approximations in the computation. For example, whenever an event has several possible outcomes, their probabilities should add up to 1. If we found that they did not, that would suggest something was amiss.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p04f2kr9\"}}</p><p>Some scientists argue that there are already good reasons to think we are inside a simulation. One is the fact that our Universe looks designed.</p><p>The constants of nature, such as the strengths of the fundamental forces, have values that look fine-tuned to make life possible. Even small alterations would mean that atoms were no longer stable, or that stars could not form. Why this is so is one of the deepest mysteries in cosmology.</p><blockquote><p> There are limits to the resolution with which we can observe the Universe, and if we try to study anything smaller, things just look \"fuzzy\" </p></blockquote><p>One possible answer invokes the \"multiverse\". Maybe there is <a href=\"http://www.bbc.com/earth/story/20160318-why-there-might-be-many-more-universes-besides-our-own\">a plethora of universes</a>, all created in Big Bang-type events and all with different laws of physics. By chance, <a href=\"http://www.bbc.com/earth/story/20160229-the-place-where-you-can-walk-through-the-universe\">some of them</a> would be fine-tuned for life &ndash; and if we were not in such a hospitable universe, we would not ask the fine-tuning question because we would not exist.</p><p>However, parallel universes are a pretty speculative idea. So it is at least conceivable that our Universe is instead a simulation whose parameters have been fine-tuned to give interesting results, like stars, galaxies and people.</p><p>While this is possible, the reasoning does not get us anywhere. After all, presumably the \"real\" Universe of our creators must also be fine-tuned for them to exist. In that case, positing that we are in a simulation does not explain the fine-tuning mystery.</p><p>Others have pointed to some of the truly weird findings of modern physics as evidence that there is something amiss.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p046h8cj\"}}</p><p>Quantum mechanics, the theory of the very small, has thrown up all sorts of odd things. For instance, both matter and energy seem to be granular. What's more, there are limits to the resolution with which we can observe the Universe, and if we try to study anything smaller, things just look \"fuzzy\".</p><blockquote><p> Ultimately, say some physicists, reality might be nothing but mathematics </p></blockquote><p>Smoot says these perplexing features of quantum physics are just what we would expect in a simulation. They are like the pixellation of a screen when you look too closely.</p><p>However, that is just a rough analogy. It is beginning to look as though the quantum graininess of nature might not be really so fundamental, but is a consequence of deeper principles about the extent to which reality is knowable.</p><p>A second argument is that the Universe appears to run on mathematical lines, just as you would expect from a computer program. Ultimately, say some physicists, reality might be nothing but mathematics.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p046h7df\"}}</p><p><a href=\"http://space.mit.edu/home/tegmark/\">Max Tegmark</a> of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology argues that this is just what we would expect if the laws of physics were based on a computational algorithm.</p><blockquote><p> We might just be superimposing our current preoccupations onto the laws of physics </p></blockquote><p>However, that argument seems rather circular. For one thing, if some super-intelligence were running simulations of their own \"real\" world, they could be expected to base its physical principles on those in their own universe, just as we do. In that case, the reason our world is mathematical would not be because it runs on a computer, but because the \"real\" world is also that way.</p><p>Conversely, simulations would not have to be based on mathematical rules. They could be set up, for example, to work randomly. Whether that would result in any coherent outcomes is not clear, but the point is that we cannot use the apparently mathematical nature of the Universe to deduce anything about its \"reality\".</p><p>However, based on his own research in fundamental physics, <a href=\"https://umdphysics.umd.edu/people/faculty/current/item/167-gatess.html\">James Gates</a> of the University of Maryland thinks there is a more specific reason for suspecting that the laws of physics are dictated by a computer simulation.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p04f2kr9\"}}</p><p>Gates studies matter at the level of subatomic particles like quarks, the constituents of protons and neutrons in the atomic nucleus. He says the rules governing these particles' behaviour turn out to have features that resemble the codes that correct for errors in manipulating data in computers. So perhaps those rules really are computer codes?</p><p>Maybe. Or maybe interpreting these physical laws as error-correcting codes is just the latest example of the way we have always interpreted nature on the basis of our advanced technologies.</p><p>At one time Newtonian mechanics seemed to make the universe a clockwork mechanism, and more recently genetics was seen &ndash; at the dawn of the computer age &ndash; as a kind of digital code with storage and readout functions. We might just be superimposing our current preoccupations onto the laws of physics.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p04f2kr9\"}}</p><p>It is likely to be profoundly difficult if not impossible to find strong evidence that we are in a simulation. Unless the simulation was really rather error-strewn, it will be hard to design a test for which the results could not be explained in some other way.</p><p>We might never know, says Smoot, simply because our minds would not be up to the task. After all, you design your agents in a simulation to function within the rules of the game, not to subvert them. This might be a box we cannot think outside of.</p><blockquote><p> The Universe can be regarded as a giant quantum computer </p></blockquote><p>There is, however, a more profound reason why perhaps we should not get too worried by the idea that we are just information being manipulated in a vast computation. Because that is what some physicists think the \"real\" world is like anyway.</p><p>Quantum theory itself is increasingly being couched in terms of information and computation. Some physicists feel that, at its most fundamental level, nature might not be pure mathematics but pure information: bits, like the ones and zeros of computers. The influential theoretical physicist John Wheeler dubbed this notion \"<a href=\"https://plus.maths.org/content/it-bit\">It From Bit</a>\".</p><p>In this view, everything that happens, from the interactions of fundamental particles upwards, is <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1312.4455\">a kind of computation</a>.</p><p>\"The Universe can be regarded as a giant quantum computer,\" says <a href=\"http://meche.mit.edu/people/faculty/SLLOYD@MIT.EDU\">Seth Lloyd</a> of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. \"If one looks at the 'guts' of the Universe &ndash; the structure of matter at its smallest scale &ndash; then those guts consist of nothing more than [quantum] bits undergoing local, digital operations.\"</p><p>This gets to the nub of the matter. If reality is just information, then we are no more or less \"real\" if we are in a simulation or not. In either case, information is all we can be.</p><p>Does it make a difference if that information were programmed by nature or by super-intelligent creators? It is not obvious why it should &ndash; except that, in the latter case, presumably our creators could in principle intervene in the simulation, or even switch it off. How should we feel about that?</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p046h775\"}}</p><p>Tegmark, mindful of this possibility, has recommended that we had all better go out and do interesting things with our lives, just in case our simulators get bored.</p><p>I think this is said at least half in jest. After all, there are surely better reasons to want to lead interesting lives than that they might otherwise be erased. But it inadvertently betrays some of the problems with the whole concept.</p><blockquote><p> If reality is just information, then we are no more or less \"real\" if we are in a simulation or not </p></blockquote><p>The idea of super-intelligent simulators saying \"Ah look, this run is a bit dull &ndash; let's stop it and start another\" is comically anthropomorphic. Like Kurzweil's comment about a school project, it imagines our \"creators\" as fickle teenagers with Xboxes.</p><p>The discussion of Bostrom's three possibilities involves a similar kind of solipsism. It is an attempt to say something profound about the Universe by extrapolating from what humans in the 21st Century are up to. The argument boils down to: \"We make computer games. I bet super-beings would too, only they'd be awesome!\"</p><p>In trying to imagine what super-intelligent beings might do, or even what they would consist of, we have little choice but to start from ourselves. But that should not obscure the fact that we are then spinning webs from a thread of ignorance.</p><p>It is surely no coincidence that many advocates of the \"universal simulation\" idea attest to being avid science-fiction fans in their youth. This might have inspired them to imagine futures and alien intelligences, but it may also have predisposed them to cast such imaginings in human terms: to see the cosmos through the windows of the Starship <em>Enterprise</em>.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p046h7ql\"}}</p><p>Perhaps mindful of such limitations, Harvard physicist <a href=\"https://www.physics.harvard.edu/people/facpages/randall\">Lisa Randall</a> is puzzled by the enthusiasm some of her colleagues show for these speculations about cosmic simulation. For her they change nothing about how we should see and investigate the world. Her bafflement is not just a \"so what\": it is a question of what we choose to understand by \"reality\".</p><blockquote><p> Plato wondered if what we perceive as reality is like the shadows projected onto the walls of a cave </p></blockquote><p>Almost certainly, Elon Musk does not go around telling himself that the people he sees around him, and his friends and family, are just computer constructs created by streams of data entering the computational nodes that encode his own consciousness.</p><p>Partly, he does not do so because it is impossible to hold that image in our heads for any sustained length of time. But more to the point, it is because we know deep down that the only notion of reality worth having is the one we experience, and not some hypothetical world \"behind\" it.</p><p>There is, however, nothing new about asking what is \"behind\" the appearances and sensations we experience. Philosophers have been doing so for centuries.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p046h64s\"}}</p><p>Plato wondered if what we perceive as reality is like <a href=\"https://faculty.washington.edu/smcohen/320/cave.htm\">the shadows projected onto the walls of a cave</a>. Immanuel Kant asserted that, while there might be some \"<a href=\"https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/thing-in-itself\">thing in itself</a>\" that underlies the appearances we perceive, we can never know it. Ren&eacute; Descartes accepted, in his famous one-liner \"<a href=\"https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/I_think_therefore_I_am\">I think therefore I am</a>\", that the capacity to think is the only meaningful criterion of existence we can attest.</p><blockquote><p> The philosopher George Berkeley argued that the world is merely an illusion </p></blockquote><p>The concept of \"the world as simulation\" takes that old philosophical saw and clothes it in the garb of our latest technologies. There is no harm in that. Like many philosophical conundrums, it impels us to examine our assumptions and preconceptions.</p><p>But until you can show that drawing distinctions between what we experience and what is \"real\" leads to demonstrable differences in what we might observe or do, it does not change our notion of reality in a meaningful way.</p><p>In the early 1700s, the philosopher <a href=\"http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/berkeley/\">George Berkeley</a> argued that the world is merely an illusion. Dismissing the idea, the ebullient English writer Samuel Johnson exclaimed \"<a href=\"http://www.samueljohnson.com/refutati.html\">I refute it thus</a>\" &ndash; and kicked a stone.</p><p>Johnson did not really refute anything.

Scientists tell us that the miniature denizens of the quantum realm behave in seemingly impossible ways: they can exist in two places at once, or disappear and reappear somewhere else instantly.</p><p>The one saving grace is that these truly bizarre quantum behaviours don&rsquo;t seem to have much of an impact on the macroscopic world as we know it, where &ldquo;classical&rdquo; physics rules the roost.</p><p>Or, at least, that&rsquo;s what scientists thought until a few years ago.</p><blockquote><p> Quantum processes might be at work behind some very familiar processes </p></blockquote><p>Now that reassuring wisdom is starting to fall apart. Quantum processes may occur not quite so far from our ordinary world as we once thought. Quite the opposite: they might be at work behind some very familiar processes, from the photosynthesis that powers plants &ndash; and ultimately feeds us all &ndash; to the familiar sight of birds on their seasonal migrations. Quantum physics might even play a role in our sense of smell.</p><p>In fact, quantum effects could be something that nature has recruited into its battery of tools to make life work better, and to make our bodies into smoother machines. It&rsquo;s even possible that we can do more with help from the strange quantum world than we could without it.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p041k8mz\"}}</p><p>At one level, photosynthesis looks very simple. Plants, green algae and some bacteria take in sunlight and carbon dioxide, and turn them into energy. What niggles in the back of biologists minds, though, is that photosynthetic organisms make the process look just a little bit too easy.</p><p>It&rsquo;s one part of photosynthesis in particular that puzzles scientists. A photon &ndash; a particle of light &ndash; after a journey of billions of kilometres hurtling through space, collides with an electron in a leaf outside your window. The electron, given a serious kick by this energy boost, starts to bounce around, a little like a pinball. It makes its way through a tiny part of the leaf&rsquo;s cell, and passes on its extra energy to a molecule that can act as an energy currency to fuel the plant.</p><blockquote><p> Photosynthetic organisms make the process look just a little bit too easy </p></blockquote><p>The trouble is, this tiny pinball machine works suspiciously well. Classical physics suggests the excited electron should take a certain amount of time to career around inside the photosynthetic machinery in the cell before emerging on the other side. In reality, the electron makes the journey far more quickly.</p><p>What&rsquo;s more, the excited electron barely loses any energy at all in the process. Classical physics would predict some wastage of energy in the noisy business of being batted around the molecular pinball machine. The process is too fast, too smooth and too efficient. It just seems too good to be true.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p041k9cq\"}}</p><p>Then, in 2007, <a href=\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/nature05678\">photosynthesis researchers began to see the light</a>. Scientists spotted signs of quantum effects in the molecular centres for photosynthesis. Tell-tale signs in the way the electrons were behaving opened the door to the idea that quantum effects could even be playing an important biological role.</p><p>This could be part of the answer to how the excited electrons pass through the photosynthetic pinball machine so quickly and efficiently. One quantum effect is the ability to exist in many places at the same time &ndash; a property known as quantum superposition. Using this property, the electron could potentially explore many routes around the biological pinball machine at once. In this way it could almost instantly select the shortest, most efficient route, involving the least amount of bouncing about.</p><p>Quantum physics had the potential to explain why photosynthesis was suspiciously efficient &ndash; a shocking revelation for biologists.</p><p>&ldquo;I think this was when people started to think that something really exciting was going on,&rdquo; says <a href=\"https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Susana_Huelga\">Susana Huelga</a>, a quantum physicist at Ulm University in Germany.</p><blockquote><p> Quantum physics had the potential to explain why photosynthesis was suspiciously efficient &ndash; a shocking revelation for biologists </p></blockquote><p>Quantum phenomena such as superposition had previously been observed mostly under highly controlled conditions. Typical experiments to observe quantum phenomena involve cooling down materials to bitingly cold temperatures in order to dampen down other atomic activity that might drown out quantum behaviour. Even at those temperatures, materials must be isolated in a vacuum &ndash; and the quantum behaviours are so subtle that scientists need exquisitely sensitive instruments to see what&rsquo;s going on.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p041k9q6\"}}</p><p>The wet, warm, bustling environment of living cells is the last place you might expect to see quantum events. &ldquo;[But] even here, quantum features are still alive,&rdquo; Huelga says.</p><p>Of course, just because these quantum features make an unexpected appearance in living cells, it doesn&rsquo;t necessarily mean that they&rsquo;re playing a useful role. There are theories as to how quantum superposition may be speeding up the process of photosynthesis, but a hard link between this behaviour and a biological function is still missing, Huelga says.</p><p>&ldquo;The next step will be having some quantitative results saying that the efficiency of this biological machine is this due to quantum phenomena.&rdquo;</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p041k9zl\"}}</p><p>Quantum effects in biology aren&rsquo;t just a quirk of plants and other organisms that do the peculiar job of turning sunlight into fuel. They may also provide an answer to a scientific puzzle that&rsquo;s been around since the 19th Century: how migratory birds know which way to fly.&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p> Quantum effects in biology might explain how migratory birds know which way to fly </p></blockquote><p>In a journey thousands of kilometres long, a migratory bird such as the European robin will often fly to southern Europe or North Africa to escape particularly cold winters. This journey over an unfamiliar landscape would be dangerous, if not impossible, without a compass. Start the journey in the wrong direction and a robin setting off from Poland might end up in Siberia rather than Morocco.</p><p>A biological compass isn&rsquo;t an easy thing to picture. If there was some form of tiny magnetic iron needle-like structure spinning deep inside a robin&rsquo;s brain or eyes, biologists would almost certainly know about it by now. But no such luck: a biological structure that could do the job has never been found.</p><p>Another theory, first proposed in the late 1970s, suggested an alternative way birds might know which way to fly: perhaps they carry a chemical compass that relies on quantum phenomena to tell which way is north.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p041kb7m\"}}</p><p><a href=\"http://hore.chem.ox.ac.uk\">Peter Hore</a>, a chemist at the University of Oxford in the UK, says that such a chemical compass would work with the help of molecules with excitable lone electrons, known as radicals, and a quantum property known as spin.</p><p>Electrons in molecules usually come in pairs, spinning in opposite directions and effectively cancelling out each other&rsquo;s spin. A &ldquo;lone&rdquo; electron spinning on its own, though, isn&rsquo;t cancelled out. This means it is free to interact with its environment &ndash; including magnetic fields.</p><blockquote><p> A &ldquo;lone&rdquo; electron spinning on its own is free to interact with its environment &ndash; including magnetic fields </p></blockquote><p>As it turns out, Hore says, robins can become temporarily disorientated when exposed to radio waves &ndash; a type of electromagnetic wave &ndash; of a particular range of frequencies. If a radio wave has a frequency of just the same rate that an electron spins, it could cause the electron to resonate. This is the same kind of resonance you might experience when you sing in the shower &ndash; certain notes sound a lot louder and fuller than others. Hitting the right radio wave frequency will make the electron vibrate more vigorously in the same way.</p><p>But what does this have to do with the idea that birds use a chemical compass? The theory is that ordinarily, radicals at the back of the bird&rsquo;s eye respond to the Earth&rsquo;s magnetic field. The magnetic field will cause the electron to leave its spot in the chemical compass and start a chain of reactions to produce a particular chemical. As long as the bird keeps pointing in the same direction, more of the chemical will build up.</p><p>So the amount of this chemical present is a source of information, generating signals in the bird&rsquo;s nerve cells. As part of many different environmental cues, this information will inform the bird about whether it is pointing towards Siberia or Morocco.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p041kbdk\"}}</p><p>The radio wave observation is an important one because we would expect anything that interferes with electron spin to be able, at least in principle, to disrupt the chemical compass. It can be as useful to study why something sometimes doesn&rsquo;t work as it is to study why it generally does work.</p><p>Even so, the quantum compass remains an idea. It hasn&rsquo;t yet been found in nature. Hore has been focusing on finding out how the quantum compass can work in principle, using molecules that theoretically ought to be able to do the job.</p><blockquote><p> The quantum compass remains an idea &ndash; it hasn&rsquo;t yet been found in nature </p></blockquote><p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve done experiments on model compounds to establish the principle that one can make a chemical compass,&rdquo; Hore says. These have helped to pin down some molecules that do seem to be fit for the purpose of detecting magnetic fields, he says. &ldquo;What we don&rsquo;t know is whether they behave in exactly the same way inside a cell in the bird&rsquo;s body.&rdquo;</p><p>The magnetic compass is just part of a complex and poorly understood system of navigation in birds, Hore says. The quantum theory for how such a compass works may be the best out there so far, but there&rsquo;s still a lot of ground to cover to link up the behavioural patterns of birds with the theoretical chemistry.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p041kd8n\"}}</p><p>There is one field that seems tantalisingly close to demonstrating the reality of quantum biology, though: the science of smell.</p><p>Exactly how our noses are capable of distinguishing and identifying a myriad of differently shaped molecules is a big challenge for conventional theories of olfaction. When a smelly molecule wafts into one of our nostrils, no one is yet entirely sure what happens next. Somehow the molecule interacts with a sensor &ndash; a molecular receptor &ndash; embedded in the delicate inner skin of our nose.</p><blockquote><p> Exactly how are our noses capable of distinguishing and identifying a myriad of differently shaped molecules? </p></blockquote><p>A well-trained human nose can distinguish between thousands of different smells. But how this information is carried in the shape of the smelly molecule is a puzzle. Many molecules that are almost identical in shape, but for swapping around an atom or two, have very different smells. Vanillin smells of vanilla, but eugenol, which is very similar in shape, smells of cloves. Some molecules that are a mirror image of each other &ndash; just like your right and left hand &ndash; also have different smells. But equally, some very differently shaped molecules can smell almost exactly the same.</p><p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luca_Turin\">Luca Turin</a>, a chemist at the BSRC Alexander Fleming institute in Greece, has been working to crack the way that the properties of a molecule encode its scent. &ldquo;There is something very, very peculiar at the core of olfaction, which is that our ability to somehow analyse molecules and atoms is inconsistent with what we think we know about molecular recognition,&rdquo; Turin says.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"<a href=\"https://production.live.bbc.co.uk/ibroadcast/image/p041kdfq\">p041kdfq</a>\"}}</p><p>He argues that the molecule&rsquo;s shape alone isn&rsquo;t enough to determine its smell. He says that it&rsquo;s the quantum properties of the chemical bonds in the molecule that provides the crucial information.</p><p>According to Turin&rsquo;s quantum theory of olfaction, when a smelly molecule enters the nose and binds to a receptor, it allows a process called quantum tunnelling to happen in the receptor.</p><blockquote><p> When a smelly molecule enters the nose and binds to a receptor, it allows quantum tunnelling to happen </p></blockquote><p>In quantum tunnelling, an electron can pass through a material to jump from point A to point B in a way that seems to bypass the intervening space. As with the bird&rsquo;s quantum compass, the crucial factor is resonance. A particular bond in the smelly molecule, Turin says, can resonate with the right energy to help an electron on one side of the receptor molecule leap to the other side. The electron can only make this leap through the so-called quantum tunnel if the bond is vibrating with just the right energy.</p><p>When the electron leaps to the other site on the receptor, it could trigger a chain reaction that ends up sending signals to the brain that the receptor has come into contact with that particular molecule. This, Turin says, is an essential part of what gives a molecule its smell, and the process is fundamentally quantum.</p><p>&ldquo;Olfaction requires a mechanism that somehow involves the actual chemical composition of the molecule,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;It was that factor that found a very natural explanation in quantum tunnelling.&rdquo;</p><p>The strongest evidence for the theory is Turin&rsquo;s discovery that two molecules with extremely different shapes can smell the same if they contain bonds with similar energies.</p><p>Turin predicted that boranes &ndash; relatively rare compounds that are hard to come by &ndash; smelled very like sulphur, or rotten eggs. He&rsquo;d never smelt a borane before, so the prediction was quite a gamble.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p041kdl3\"}}</p><p>He was right. Turin says that, for him, that was the clincher. &ldquo;Borane chemistry is vastly different &ndash; in fact there&rsquo;s zero relation &ndash; to sulphur chemistry. So the only thing those two have in common is a vibrational frequency. They are the only two things out there in nature that smell of sulphur.&rdquo;</p><p>While that prediction was a great success for the theory, it&rsquo;s not ultimate proof. Ideally Turin wants to catch these receptors in the act of exploiting quantum phenomena. He says they are getting &ldquo;pretty close&rdquo; to nailing those experiments. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to jinx it, but we&rsquo;re working on it,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;We think we have a way to do it, so we&rsquo;re definitely going to have a go in the next few months. I think that nothing short of that will really move things forward.&rdquo;</p><blockquote><p> Turin wants to catch these receptors in the act of exploiting quantum phenomena </p></blockquote><p>Whether or not nature has evolved to make use of quantum phenomena to help organisms make fuel from light, tell north from south, or distinguish vanilla from clove, the strange properties of the atomic world can still tell us a lot about the finer workings of living cells</p><p>&ldquo;There is a second way of seeing how quantum mechanics interacts with biology, and that is by sensing and probing,&rdquo; Huelga says. &ldquo;Quantum probes would be able to shed light on many interesting things in the dynamics of biological systems.&rdquo;</p><p>And whether or not nature got there first, it&rsquo;s no excuse for us not to mix biology with quantum phenomena to develop new technologies, she says. Making use of quantum effects in biologically inspired photovoltaic cells, for instance, could give solar panels a huge boost in efficiency. &ldquo;At this very moment there is quite a lot of activity in organic photovoltaics, to see whether with natural or artificial structures one can have an enhanced efficiency that exploit quantum effects.&rdquo;</p><p>So even if alternative, as yet entirely unknown mechanisms emerge for these stubborn biological puzzles, biologists and quantum physicists certainly won&rsquo;t have seen the last of each other. &ldquo;This will definitely be a story with a happy end,&rdquo; she says.</p>","BusinessUnit":"worldwide","CalloutBody":"","CalloutPosition":"","CalloutSubtitle":"","CalloutTitle":"","Campaign":null,"Collection":[],"DisableAdverts":false,"DisplayDate":"2016-07-18T13:54:59Z","Geolocation":null,"HeadlineLong":"Organisms might be quantum machines","HeadlineShort":"Organisms might be quantum machines","HideRelated":false,"Horizontal":null,"HyperHorizontal":null,"Intro":"Few of us really understand the weird world of quantum physics – but our bodies might take advantage of quantum properties","IsSyndicated":true,"Latitude":"","Location":null,"Longitude":"","Option":[],"Partner":null,"PrimaryVertical":"wwearth","Programme":null,"RelatedStory":null,"RelatedTag":null,"StoryType":"image","SummaryLong":"Few of us really understand the weird world of quantum physics – but our bodies might take advantage of quantum properties","SummaryShort":"Some lifeforms may actually be part quantum","SuperSection":null,"Tag":[]},"Metadata":{"CreationDateTime":"2016-07-18T08:22:09.065591Z","Entity":"story","Guid":"61ecf413-ca61-406e-a967-04866063e5ab","Id":"wwearth/story/20160715-organisms-might-be-quantum-machines","ModifiedDateTime":"2016-12-05T16:10:03.355276Z","Project":"wwearth","Slug":"20160715-organisms-might-be-quantum-machines"},"Urn":"urn:pubstack:jative:story:wwearth/story/20160715-organisms-might-be-quantum-machines","_id":"5e517c807a3cce4376079d9a"},{"Content":{"AssetCustom":"","AssetIbroadcast":null,"AssetImage":[],"AssetImagePromo":null,"AssetInfographic":"","AssetInline":[],"AssetSelect":"","AssetVideoIb2":null,"AssetVideoMps":null,"Author":[],"BodyHtml":"<p>Every day, for billions of years, the Sun has risen over Earth's horizon. It may be 150 million kilometres away, but our star shines so brilliantly in the sky that we cannot look at it with our own eyes, lest we damage them. At the surface, the Sun is 5,500C &ndash; hot enough to melt any landing probe into oblivion before it even got close.</p><p>In other words, the Sun is literally too hot to handle. But that does not mean we cannot study it.</p><p>In fact, there are several ingenious techniques through which we have begun to unravel the secrets of the stars dotted throughout the night sky, as well as the one in our own backyard. How, then, is this possible?</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p03gqcx4\"}}</p><p>We begin with light itself. We might not be able to look at the Sun in safety, but scientific instruments can.</p><p>As you may know, \"white\" light is actually made up of all the colours of the rainbow, and we can see those colours &ndash; from deep red right through to violet &ndash; if we \"split\" the light with a prism.</p><blockquote><p> This only tells you what the composition is at the surface </p></blockquote><p>Way back in 1802 an English scientist named William Hyde Wollaston did this with the Sun's light and noticed something unexpected: dark lines in the spectrum. A few years later, the German optician Joseph von Fraunhofer <a href=\"http://www.suntrek.org/hot-solar-atmosphere/solar-fingerprints/fraunhofer-spectrum.shtml\">built a special instrument called a spectrometer</a> to disperse the light better. He saw even more of these curious dark lines.</p><p>Scientists soon realised that the dark lines showed where colours were missing from the spectrum. They were missing because elements in and around the Sun were absorbing those specific wavelengths of light. The dark lines therefore indicated the presence of certain elements such as hydrogen, sodium and calcium.</p><p>It is a remarkably clever, beautiful and simple discovery and it more or less instantly taught us about some key elements found in our nearest star. However, as <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/philipp-podsiadlowski-10a73719\">Philipp Podsiadlowski</a>, a physicist at the University of Oxford, points out, this approach has its limitations. \"This only tells you what the composition is at the surface, it doesn't tell you anything about the composition at the centre of the Sun,\" he says.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p03gqcs2\"}}</p><p>So what is inside the Sun, and do the contents help explain how it got its colossal energy?</p><p>Our understanding of the Sun's massive energy output began to crystallise early in the 20th Century, when it was theorised that if hydrogen atoms could fuse together they would create an entirely different element &ndash; helium &ndash; and release energy in the process. It seemed likely, then, that the Sun was rich in hydrogen and helium, and owed its mighty power to the formation of the latter from the former. But the idea still had to be proved.</p><blockquote><p> If it were not for special detectors, we would never know they were there </p></blockquote><p>\"People in the 1930s realised that the Sun was probably powered by the fusion of hydrogen, but that of course [was] still theory,\" explains Podsiadlowski.</p><p>This is where studying the Sun gets really strange. In order to better understand the star that gave life to our world, we have to go underground. In fact, we have to bury our experiments underneath mountains. That is how the Japanese Super-Kamiokande (Super-K) detector was designed, anyway.</p><p>Some 1,000m below the surface lies an odd-looking, dingy room. It contains a shallow lake of extremely pure water, and 13,000 spherical objects cover the walls, ceiling and underwater floor.</p><p>It looks like something from science fiction, but Super-K is devoted to better understanding the reality of how our Sun works.</p><p>Being so far underground, it is obvious that Super-K is not built to detect light. Instead, it is waiting for very special particles that originate in the centre of our star and which fly through matter like a plane flies through the air.</p><p>There are many trillions of them passing through you every second. If it were not for special detectors, we would never know they were there. But the Super-K can pick up a few, roughly 40 a day, thanks to the detection of special light that is created when these particles &ndash; called neutrinos &ndash; interact, as they occasionally do, with its pool of pure water.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p03gv2w7\"}}</p><p>The light that is created is incredibly faint, but it generates a sort of halo around the neutrino and that halo can be picked up by the phenomenally sensitive light detectors covering the detector's walls.</p><blockquote><p> These neutrinos are formed in fusion reactions right inside the centre of the Sun </p></blockquote><p>Special types of neutrinos which are identified through this method are considered direct evidence that the nuclear fusion of hydrogen into helium is happening inside the Sun. We know of no other way to explain the neutrinos' formation.</p><p>\"You can only capture a tiny fraction of the neutrinos but you can then calculate how many neutrinos there must be given the numbers that are actually observed,\" says Podsiadlowski.</p><p>What is even more astounding is that these neutrinos are formed in fusion reactions right inside the centre of the Sun, and they get picked up by the Super-K detector just eight minutes later. Studying them allows us to observe what is going on deep inside the Sun in more or less real time.</p><p>If that wasn't enough, <a href=\"https://newhumanist.org.uk/articles/2402\">we can even image the Sun using this method</a>. It is actually possible to create pictures of the Sun's interior solely from measurements made underground, where sunlight cannot reach.</p><blockquote><p> The Sun has two advantages that tip the scale in the favour of fusion </p></blockquote><p>In order to better understand the details of those fusion reactions, though, it is also necessary to try to recreate them here on Earth. In principle this is not difficult: <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/science/science-video/10680762/Schoolboys-nuclear-fusion-test-how-he-did-it.html\">a 13-year-old British schoolboy successfully initiated a fusion reaction in</a> 2014. But if you want to keep observing those reactions without interference from particles whizzing in from the Sun itself, you have to go underground again.</p><p>This is precisely what <a href=\"http://marialuisaaliotta.com\">Marialuisa Aliotta</a>, a nuclear physicist at the University of Edinburgh, does.</p><p>One of the difficult things about fusion reactions, explains Aliotta, is actually getting any two atoms to \"agree\" to fuse. The probability of this happening, despite having trillions of atoms floating around, is incredibly low.</p><p>The Sun has two advantages that tip the scale in the favour of fusion, though. It is massive so it has a surplus of atoms, and it also has a lot of gravity, which compresses the hydrogen into plasma: hydrogen gas at such a great pressure that electrons are separated from protons in the nucleus. This environment makes it easier for fusion reactions to happen.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p03gqcxs\"}}</p><p>\"In a star like our Sun, the probability that a significant amount of energy can be liberated through nuclear reactions is very high simply because there are lots of protons,\" explains Aliotta. \"In the lab we don't have this many protons and so it becomes very, very difficult to study these processes.\"</p><blockquote><p> The Sun's energy output waned and then waxed again </p></blockquote><p>Still, Aliotta is able to experiment with fusion at facilities like the Laboratory for Underground Nuclear Astrophysics (LUNA) in Italy. The work enables Aliotta and her colleagues to learn more about what happens when fusion takes place &ndash; what products are created and how those particles interact.</p><p>It is easy to get the impression that the Sun is a permanent fixture that will shine with a constant level of brightness forever. It will not. In fact, stars have cycles and lifespans which, depending on their size and the precise proportions of elements within them, can be quite varied.</p><p>In recent years we have been able to learn a lot more about how the Sun changes by studying some of its features. Sunspots, for example, are dark, temporary patches that appear on the surface of the Sun from time to time. Probes have been able to study precisely how much radiation, including visible light, has been emitted by the Sun over the course of several years.</p><p>In the 1980s, researchers working on the <a href=\"http://solarscience.msfc.nasa.gov/SMM.shtml\">Solar Maximum Mission</a> realised that over the course of around 10 years, the Sun's energy output waned and then waxed again. What was really striking was that the number of sunspots correlated with this activity: the more there were, the more energy was being released from the Sun. Since sunspots are darker and colder than the rest of the solar surface, this was a surprise.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p03gqcvq\"}}</p><p>\"It was the inverse,\" says <a href=\"https://uk.linkedin.com/in/simon-foster-1259a34\">Simon Foster</a> at Imperial College, London. \"This was very peculiar, you've got more dark features, more cold features yet the Sun's in effect hotter.\"</p><blockquote><p> Radio telescopes are very good at catching the really interesting bits of a star's life </p></blockquote><p>Foster says that scientists eventually discovered the cause. There are special bright areas on the Sun's surface &ndash; called faculae &ndash; which coincide with sunspots but are distinct from them so that both are visible. It is these faculae that release the extra energy.</p><p>As well as sunspots, it is also possible to detect solar flares &ndash; massive flashes of matter that burst out from the Sun's surface following a build-up in magnetic energy. Because <a href=\"http://www.darvill.clara.net/emag/\">stars emit radiation across the electromagnetic spectrum</a>, these flares can be seen with <a href=\"http://hesperia.gsfc.nasa.gov/sftheory/fulldisk.htm\">X-ray detectors</a>. But there are other ways to detect them. One tactic is to listen to radio waves &ndash; another form of electromagnetic radiation.</p><p>The huge radio telescope at <a href=\"http://www.jodrellbank.net/\">Jodrell Bank</a> in England, the first of its kind in the world, is able to detect solar flares, says <a href=\"http://www.jb.man.ac.uk/~tob/\">Tim O'Brien</a> at the University of Manchester, who works at the telescope.</p><p>In fact, radio telescopes are very good at catching the really interesting bits of a star's life. When a star is behaving \"normally\", without much activity, it does not emit many radio waves. But when stars are born, or when they die, great radio wave emissions are produced.</p><p>\"What we see are the active events. We see the explosions of stars, we see shockwaves, we see stellar winds,\" says O'Brien.</p><blockquote><p> Some stars are destined to become pulsars </p></blockquote><p>Radio telescopes were also used by Northern Irish scientist Jocelyn Bell Burnell to discover <a href=\"http://www.bbc.com/earth/story/20150805-the-most-accurate-clocks-in-space\">pulsars</a> &ndash; a special type of neutron star.</p><p>Neutron stars form after gigantic supernova explosions in which a star collapses back in on itself to become incredibly dense. Pulsars are cases of such neutron stars which happen to emit a beam of electromagnetic radiation at their poles and it is this that can be detected by radio telescopes.</p><p>It is such a regular signal, emitting as frequently as every few milliseconds, that some researchers initially wondered if they were some form of communication by intelligent species elsewhere in the Universe.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p03gqcyh\"}}</p><p>Thanks to the discovery of many more pulsars, it is now accepted that this regular pulse is caused by the spinning of the star itself.</p><p>\"It spins about its vertical axis and this beam is sticking out diagonally &ndash; that then sweeps about the sky,\" explains O'Brien. \"If you happen to be looking at it along the line of sight, you see the regular flash as the beam sweeps past. Just like a lighthouse.\"</p><blockquote><p> This \"white dwarf\" will slowly cool down over a trillion years </p></blockquote><p>Some stars are destined to become pulsars. But our Sun is almost certainly not in their ranks: it is too small to explode in a supernova reaction at the end of its life. What, then, is its likely fate in billions of years' time?</p><p>We know from observing other stars around us in the galaxy that there is a range of end-of-life possibilities. But given what we know about the mass of our Sun and having compared it to similar stars out there, its future seems reasonably clear.</p><p>We expect that it will gradually expand towards the end of its life &ndash; in another 5 billion years or so &ndash; to become a red giant. The radiation it emits will be weaker than before as the hydrogen fuel which powers it gets used up. This \"weaker\" light will have a lower frequency, since it has less energy, and the Sun will therefore <a href=\"http://www.historyoftheuniverse.com/?p=redgiant.htm\">literally become redder</a>.</p><p>Then, following a series of explosions, all that will remain will be the Sun's inner core of carbon &ndash; essentially a diamond as large as Earth. This \"white dwarf\" will slowly cool down over a trillion years.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p03gqcs4\"}}</p><p>There are still many mysteries about the Sun, and there are some exciting projects on the way which will help to unravel them.</p><blockquote><p> We have been able to answer many important questions about the nature of our Sun </p></blockquote><p>One example is the Solar Probe Plus, <a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/sites/brucedorminey/2015/11/30/nasa-solar-probe-will-literally-touch-the-sun/\">which will come closer to the Sun than any other probe in history</a>, in order to try and find out more about how solar winds are produced and discover why the Sun's corona &ndash; an aura of plasma around the star &ndash; is hotter than its actual surface.</p><p>But we know many of the fundamentals.

Physicists have proposed several candidate forms of \"multiverse\", each made possible by a different aspect of the laws of physics.</p><p>The trouble is, virtually by definition we probably cannot ever visit these other universes to confirm that they exist. So the question is, can we devise other ways to test for the existence of entire universes that we cannot see or touch?</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p03n5pgh\"}}</p><p><strong>Worlds within worlds</strong></p><p>In at least some of these alternative universes, it has been suggested, we have doppelg&auml;ngers living lives much like &ndash; perhaps almost identical to &ndash; our own.</p><blockquote><p> Giordano Bruno speculated that the Universe might be infinite </p></blockquote><p>That idea tickles our ego and awakens our fantasies, which is doubtless why the multiverse theories, however far-out they seem, enjoy so much popularity. We have embraced alternative universes in works of fiction ranging from Philip K. Dick's <em>The Man in the High Castle</em> to movies like <em>Sliding Doors</em>.</p><p>Indeed, there is nothing new about the idea of a multiverse, as philosopher of religion Mary-Jane Rubenstein explains in her 2014 book <em>Worlds Without End</em>.</p><p>In the mid-16th century, Copernicus argued that the Earth is not the centre of the Universe. Several decades later, Galileo's telescope showed him stars beyond measure: a glimpse of the vastness of the cosmos.</p><p>So at the end of the 16th century, the Italian philosopher Giordano Bruno speculated that the Universe might be infinite, populated by an infinite number of inhabited worlds.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p03n5pbc\"}}</p><p>The idea of a Universe containing many solar systems became commonplace in the 18th Century.</p><p>By the early 20th Century, the Irish physicist Edmund Fournier d'Albe was even suggesting that there might be an infinite regression of \"nested\" universes at different scales, ever larger and ever smaller. In this view, an individual atom might be like a real, inhabited solar system.</p><p>Scientists today reject that notion of a \"Russian doll\" multiverse, but they have postulated several other ways in which multiverses might exist. Here are five of them, along with a rough guide to how likely they are.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p03n5r5f\"}}</p><p><strong>The patchwork universe</strong></p><p>The simplest multiverse is a consequence of the infinite size of our own Universe.</p><blockquote><p> There must be worlds identical to Earth somewhere out there </p></blockquote><p>We do not actually know if the Universe is infinite, but we cannot rule it out. If it is, then it must be divided into a patchwork of regions that cannot see one another.</p><p>This is simply because the regions are too far apart for light to have crossed the distance. Our Universe is only 13.8 billion years old, so any regions further than 13.8 billion light years apart are utterly cut off.</p><p>To all intents and purposes, these regions are separate universes. But they will not stay that way: eventually light will cross the divide and the universes will merge.</p><p>If our Universe really does contain an infinite number of \"island universes\" like ours, with matter and stars and planets, there must be worlds identical to Earth somewhere out there.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p03n5qky\"}}</p><p>It may sound incredibly unlikely that atoms should come together by chance into an exact replica of Earth, or a replica that is exact except for the colour of your socks. But in a genuine infinity of worlds, even that strange place must exist. In fact, it must exist countless times.</p><blockquote><p> The Universe began as an infinitesimally tiny point and then expanded incredibly fast in a super-heated fireball </p></blockquote><p>If so, then somewhere almost unimaginably far off, a being identical to me is typing out these words, and wondering if his editor is going to insist on radical revisions. <em>[nice try Phil - ed]</em></p><p>By the same logic, rather farther away there is an entire observable universe identical to ours. This distance can be estimated at about 10 to the power 10 to the power 118 metres.</p><p>It is possible that this is not the case at all. Maybe the Universe is not infinite. Or even if it is, maybe all the matter is concentrated in our corner of it, in which case most of the other universes could be empty. But there is no obvious reason why that should be, and no sign so far that matter gets sparser the farther away we look.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p03n5rcw\"}}</p><p><strong>The inflationary multiverse</strong></p><p>The second multiverse theory arises from our best ideas about <a href=\"http://www.bbc.com/earth/story/20141106-why-does-anything-exist-at-all\">how our own Universe began</a>.</p><p>According to the predominant view of the Big Bang, the Universe began as an infinitesimally tiny point and then expanded incredibly fast in a super-heated fireball. A fraction of a second after this expansion began, it may have fleetingly accelerated at a truly enormous rate, far faster than the speed of light. This burst is called \"inflation\".</p><blockquote><p> There are many, perhaps infinitely many, universes appearing and growing all the time </p></blockquote><p>Inflationary theory explains why the Universe is relatively uniform everywhere we look. Inflation blew up the fireball to a cosmic scale before it had a chance to get too clumpy.</p><p>However, that primordial state would have been ruffled by tiny chance variations, which also got blown up by inflation. These fluctuations are now preserved in the cosmic microwave background radiation, the faint afterglow of the Big Bang. This radiation pervades the Universe, but it is not perfectly uniform.</p><p>Several satellite-based telescopes have mapped out these variations in fine detail, and compared them to those predicted by inflationary theory. The match is almost unbelievably good, suggesting that inflation really did happen.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p03n5qs0\"}}</p><p>This suggests that we can understand how the Big Bang happened &ndash; in which case we can reasonably ask if it happened more than once.</p><p>The current view is that the Big Bang happened when a patch of ordinary space, containing no matter but filled with energy, appeared within a different kind of space called the \"false vacuum\". It then grew like an expanding bubble.</p><blockquote><p> Perhaps our Universe is simply one of a crowd </p></blockquote><p>But according to this theory, the false vacuum should also experience a kind of inflation, causing it to expand at fantastic speed. Meanwhile, other bubble universes of \"true vacuum\" can appear within it &ndash; and not just, like our Universe, 13.8 billion years ago, but constantly.</p><p>This scenario is called \"eternal inflation\". It suggests there are many, perhaps infinitely many, universes appearing and growing all the time. But we can never reach them, even if we travel at the speed of light forever, because they are receding too fast for us ever to catch up.</p><p>The UK Astronomer Royal Martin Rees suggests that the inflationary multiverse theory represents a \"fourth Copernican revolution\": the fourth time that we have been forced to downgrade our status in the heavens. After Copernicus suggested Earth was just one planet among others, we realized that our Sun is just one star in our galaxy, and that other stars might have planets. Then we discovered that our galaxy is just one among countless more in an expanding Universe. And now perhaps our Universe is simply one of a crowd.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p03n5q6r\"}}</p><p>We do not yet know for sure if inflationary theory is true.</p><p>However, if eternal inflation does create a multiverse from an endless series of Big Bangs, it could help to resolve one of the biggest problems in modern physics.</p><blockquote><p> The fundamental constants of the laws of physics seem bizarrely fine-tuned to the values needed for life to exist </p></blockquote><p>Some physicists have long been searching for a \"<a href=\"http://www.bbc.com/earth/story/20150409-can-science-ever-explain-everything\">theory of everything</a>\": a set of basic laws, or perhaps just a single equation, from which all the other principles of physics can be derived. But they have found there are more alternatives to choose from than there are fundamental particles in the known universe.</p><p>Many physicists who delve into these waters believe that an idea called string theory is the best candidate for a \"final theory\". But the latest version offers a huge number of distinct solutions: 1 followed by 500 zeros. Each solution yields its own set of physical laws, and we have no obvious reason to prefer one over any other.</p><p>The inflationary multiverse relieves us of the need to choose at all. If parallel universes have been popping up in an inflating false vacuum for billions of years, each could have different physical laws, determined by one of these many solutions to string theory.</p><p>If that is true, it could help us explain a strange property of our own Universe.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p03n5q47\"}}</p><p>The fundamental constants of the laws of physics seem bizarrely fine-tuned to the values needed for life to exist.</p><blockquote><p> Things have to be the way we find them: if they were not, we would not be here and the question would never arise </p></blockquote><p>For example, if the strength of the electromagnetic force were just a little different, atoms would not be stable. Just a 4% change would prevent all nuclear fusion in stars, the process that makes the carbon atoms our bodies are largely made of.</p><p>Similarly, there is a delicate balance between gravity, which pulls matter towards itself, and so-called dark energy, which does the opposite and makes the Universe expand ever faster. This is just what is needed to make stars possible while not collapsing the Universe on itself.</p><p>In this and several other ways, <a href=\"http://www.bbc.com/earth/story/20160229-the-place-where-you-can-walk-through-the-universe\">the Universe seems fine-tuned to host us</a>. This has made some people suspect the hand of God.</p><p>Yet an inflationary multiverse, in which all conceivable physical laws operate somewhere, offers an alternative explanation.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p03n5pcw\"}}</p><p>In every universe set up in this life-friendly way, the argument goes, intelligent beings will be scratching their heads trying to understand their luck. In the far more numerous universes that are set up differently, there is no one to ask the question.</p><blockquote><p> If you don't want God, you'd better have a multiverse </p></blockquote><p>This is an example of the \"anthropic principle\", which says that things have to be the way we find them: if they were not, we would not be here and the question would never arise.</p><p>For many physicists and philosophers, this argument is a cheat: a way to evade rather than explain the fine-tuning problem.</p><p>How can we test these assertions, they ask? Surely it is defeatist to accept that there is no reason why the laws of nature are what they are, and simply say that in other universes they are different?</p><p>The trouble is, unless you have some other explanation for fine-tuning, someone will assert that God must have set things up this way. The astrophysicist Bernard Carr has put it bluntly: \"<a href=\"http://discovermagazine.com/2008/dec/10-sciences-alternative-to-an-intelligent-creator\">If you don't want God, you'd better have a multiverse</a>\".</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p03n5pl4\"}}</p><p><strong>Cosmic natural selection</strong></p><p>Another kind of multiverse avoids what some see as the slipperiness of this reasoning, offering a solution to the fine-tuning problem without invoking the anthropic principle.</p><blockquote><p> A \"mother\" universe can give birth to \"baby\" universes </p></blockquote><p>It was formulated by <a href=\"http://leesmolin.com/\">Lee Smolin</a> of the Perimeter Institute for Theoretical Physics in Waterloo, Canada. In 1992 <a href=\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1088/0264-9381/9/1/016\" target=\"_blank\">he proposed</a> that universes might reproduce and evolve rather like living things do.</p><p>On Earth, natural selection favours the emergence of \"useful\" traits such as fast running or opposable thumbs. In the multiverse, Smolin argues, there might be some pressure that favours universes like ours. He calls this \"cosmological natural selection\".</p><p>Smolin's idea is that a \"mother\" universe can give birth to \"baby\" universes, which form inside it. The mother universe can do this if it contains black holes.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p03n5r7s\"}}</p><p>A <a href=\"http://www.bbc.com/earth/story/20150525-a-black-hole-would-clone-you\">black hole</a> forms when a huge star collapses under the pull of its own gravity, crushing all the atoms together until they reach infinite density.</p><blockquote><p> It is a neat idea, because our Universe then does not have to be the product of pure chance </p></blockquote><p>In the 1960s, Stephen Hawking and Roger Penrose pointed out that <a href=\"http://www.bbc.com/earth/story/20160107-these-are-the-discoveries-that-made-stephen-hawking-famous\">this collapse is like a mini-Big Bang in reverse</a>. This suggested to Smolin that a black hole could become a Big Bang, spawning an entire new universe within itself.</p><p>If that is so, then the new universe might have slightly different physical properties from the one that made the black hole. This is like the random genetic mutations that mean baby organisms are different from their parents.</p><p>If a baby universe has physical laws that permit the formation of atoms, stars and life, it will also inevitably contain black holes. That will mean it can have more baby universes of its own. Over time, universes like this will become more common than those without black holes, which cannot reproduce.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p03n5r15\"}}</p><p>It is a neat idea, because our Universe then does not have to be the product of pure chance. If a fine-tuned universe arose at random, surrounded by many other universes that were not fine-tuned, cosmic natural selection would mean that fine-tuned universes subsequently became the norm.</p><blockquote><p> So far, there is no evidence that this is the case </p></blockquote><p>The details of the idea are a little woolly, but Smolin points out that it has one big advantage: we can test it.</p><p>For example, if Smolin is right we should expect our Universe to be especially suited to making black holes. This is a rather more demanding criterion than simply saying it should support the existence of atoms.</p><p>But so far, there is no evidence that this is the case &ndash; let alone proof that a black hole really can spawn an entirely new universe.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p03n5qhf\"}}</p><p><strong>The brane multiverse</strong></p><p>When <a href=\"http://www.bbc.com/earth/story/20151118-watch-this-video-to-understand-the-biggest-idea-in-physics\">Albert Einstein's theory of general relativity</a> began to come to public attention in the 1920s, many people speculated about the \"fourth dimension\" that Einstein had allegedly invoked. What might be in there? A hidden universe, maybe?</p><blockquote><p> Perhaps the fifth dimension was curled up into an unimaginably small distance </p></blockquote><p>This was nonsense. Einstein was not proposing a new dimension. What he was saying was that time is a dimension, similar to the three dimensions of space. All four are woven into a single fabric called space-time, which matter distorts to produce gravity.</p><p>Even so, other physicists were already starting to speculate about genuinely new dimensions in space.</p><p>The first intimation of hidden dimensions began with the work of the theoretical physicist Theodor Kaluza. <a href=\"http://homepage.uibk.ac.at/~c705204/pdf/kaluza-1921.pdf\">In a 1921 paper</a> Kaluza showed that, by adding an extra dimension to the equations of Einstein's theory of general relativity, he could obtain an extra equation that seemed to predict the existence of light.</p><p>That looked promising. But where, then, was this extra dimension?</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p03n5q1d\"}}</p><p>The Swedish physicist Oskar Klein <a href=\"http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v118/n2971/abs/118516a0.html\">offered an answer in 1926</a>. Perhaps the fifth dimension was curled up into an unimaginably small distance: about a billion-trillion-trillionth of a centimetre.</p><blockquote><p> In the modern version of string theory, known as M-theory, there are up to seven hidden dimensions </p></blockquote><p>The idea of a dimension being curled may seem strange, but it is actually a familiar phenomenon. A garden hose is a three-dimensional object, but from far enough away it looks like a one-dimensional line, because the other two dimensions are so small. Similarly, it takes so little time to cross Klein's extra dimension that we do not notice it.</p><p>Physicists have since taken Kaluza and Klein's ideas much further in string theory. This seeks to explain fundamental particles as the vibrations of even smaller entities called strings.</p><p>When string theory was developed in the 1980s, it turned out that it could only work if there were extra dimensions. In the modern version of string theory, known as M-theory, there are up to seven hidden dimensions.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p03n5py2\"}}</p><p>What's more, these dimensions need not be compact after all. They can be extended regions called branes (short for \"membranes\"), which may be multi-dimensional.</p><blockquote><p> If branes collide, the results could be monumental </p></blockquote><p>A brane might be a perfectly adequate hiding place for an entire universe. M-theory postulates a multiverse of branes of various dimensions, coexisting rather like a stack of papers.</p><p>If this is true, there should be a new class of particles called Kaluza-Klein particles. In theory we could make them, perhaps in a particle accelerator like the Large Hadron Collider. They would have distinctive signatures, because some of their momentum is carried in the hidden dimensions.</p><p>These brane worlds should remain quite distinct and separate from each other, because forces like gravity do not pass between them. But if branes collide, the results could be monumental. Conceivably, such a collision could have triggered our own Big Bang.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p03n5rfb\"}}</p><p>It has also been proposed that gravity, uniquely among the fundamental forces, might \"leak\" between branes. This leakage could explain why gravity is so weak compared to the other fundamental forces.</p><blockquote><p> If their idea is true, there is an awful lot of space out there for other universes </p></blockquote><p>As <a href=\"https://www.physics.harvard.edu/people/facpages/randall\">Lisa Randall</a> of Harvard University puts it: \"if gravity is spread out over large extra dimensions, its force would be diluted.\"</p><p>In 1999, Randall and her colleague Raman Sundrum suggested that the branes do not just carry gravity, <a href=\"https://dx.doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevLett.83.3370\">they produce it by curving space</a>. In effect this means that a brane \"concentrates\" gravity, so that it looks weak in a second brane nearby.</p><p>This could also explain why we could live on a brane with infinite extra dimensions without noticing them. If their idea is true, there is an awful lot of space out there for other universes.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p03n5qfx\"}}</p><p><strong>The quantum multiverse</strong></p><p>The theory of quantum mechanics is one of the most successful in all of science. It explains the behaviour of very small objects, such as atoms and their constituent fundamental particles. It can predict all kinds of phenomena, from the shapes of molecules to the way light and matter interact, with phenomenal accuracy.</p><p>Quantum mechanics treats particles as if they are waves, and describes them with a mathematical expression called a wave function.</p><blockquote><p> When we make a measurement we only see one of those realities, but the others also exist </p></blockquote><p>Perhaps the strangest feature of a wave function is that it allows a quantum particle to exist in several states at once. This is called a superposition.</p><p>But superpositions are generally destroyed as soon as we measure the object in any way. An observation \"forces\" the object to \"choose\" one particular state.</p><p>This switch from a superposition to a single state, caused by measurement, is called \"collapse of the wave function\". The trouble is, it is not really described by quantum mechanics, so no one knows how or why it happens.</p><p><a href=\"http://www-tc.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/manyworlds/pdf/dissertation.pdf\">In his 1957 doctoral thesis</a>, the American physicist Hugh Everett suggested that we might stop fretting about the awkward nature of wave function collapse, and just do away with it.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p03n5pn9\"}}</p><p>Everett suggested that objects do not switch from multiple states to a single state when they are measured or observed. Instead, all the possibilities encoded in the wave function are equally real. When we make a measurement we only see one of those realities, but the others also exist.</p><p>This is known as the \"many worlds interpretation\" of quantum mechanics.</p><blockquote><p> To avoid wave function collapse, you must make another universe </p></blockquote><p>Everett was not very specific about where these other states actually exist. But in the 1970s, the physicist <a href=\"http://www.utexas.edu/faculty/council/2006-2007/memorials/dewitt/dewitt.html\">Bryce DeWitt</a> argued that each alternative outcome must exist in a parallel reality: another world.</p><p>Suppose you conduct an experiment in which you measure the path of an electron. In this world it goes one way, but in another world it goes another way.</p><p>That requires a parallel apparatus for the electron to pass through. It also requires a parallel you to measure it. In fact you have to build an entire parallel universe around that one electron, identical in all respects except where the electron went.</p><p>In short, to avoid wave function collapse, you must make another universe.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p03n5r9r\"}}</p><p>This picture really gets extravagant when you appreciate what a measurement is. In DeWitt's view, any interaction between two quantum entities, say <a href=\"http://www.bbc.com/earth/story/20150731-what-is-a-ray-of-light-made-of\">a photon of light</a> bouncing off an atom, can produce alternative outcomes and therefore parallel universes.</p><blockquote><p> The quantum multiverse must be in some sense real, because quantum theory demands it and quantum theory works </p></blockquote><p>As DeWitt put it, \"every quantum transition taking place on every star, in every galaxy, in every remote corner of the Universe is splitting our local world on earth into myriads of copies.\"</p><p>Not everyone sees Everett's many-worlds interpretation this way. Some say it is largely a mathematical convenience, and that we cannot say anything meaningful about the contents of those alternative universes.</p><p>But others take seriously the idea that there are countless other \"yous\", created every time a quantum measurement is made. The quantum multiverse must be in some sense real, they say, because quantum theory demands it and quantum theory works.</p><p>You either buy that argument or you do not. But if you accept it, you must also accept something rather unsettling.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p03n6lxq\"}}</p><p>The other kinds of parallel universes, such as those created by eternal inflation, are truly \"other worlds\". They exist somewhere else in space and time, or in other dimensions. They might contain exact copies of you, but those copies are separate, like a body double living on another continent.</p><blockquote><p> Who are we to judge what is weird and what is not? </p></blockquote><p>In contrast, the other universes of the many-worlds interpretation do not exist in other dimensions or other regions of space. Instead, they are right here, superimposed on our Universe but invisible and inaccessible. The other selves they contain really are \"you\".</p><p>In fact, there is no meaningful \"you\" at all. \"You\" are becoming distinct beings an absurd number of times every second: just think of all the quantum events that happen as a single electrical signal travels along a single neuron in your brain. \"You\" vanish into the crowd.</p><p>In other words, an idea that started out as a mathematical convenience ends up implying that there is no such thing as individuality.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p03n5q8z\"}}</p><p><strong>Testing the multiverse</strong></p><p>Given the strange implications of parallel universes, you might be forgiven some skepticism about whether they exist.</p><p>But who are we to judge what is weird and what is not? Scientific ideas stand or fall, not by how they \"feel\" to us, but by experimental testing.</p><p>And that is the problem. An alternative universe is separate from our own. By definition, it is beyond reach and out of sight. On the whole, multiverse theories cannot be tested by looking for those other worlds.</p><p>Yet even if other universes cannot be experienced directly, it might be possible to find evidence to support the reasoning behind them.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p03n5r30\"}}</p><p>For example, we could find strong evidence for the inflationary theory of the Big Bang. That would strengthen, but not prove, the case for an inflationary multiverse.</p><blockquote><p> It's proven remarkably hard to write down a theory which produces exactly the universe we see and nothing more </p></blockquote><p>Some cosmologists have proposed that an inflationary multiverse might be more directly tested. A collision between our expanding bubble universe and another one should leave detectable traces in the cosmic microwave background &ndash; if we were close enough to see them.</p><p>Similarly, experiments envisaged for the <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-35780444\">Large Hadron Collider</a> could search for evidence of the additional dimensions and particles implied by the braneworld theory.</p><p>Some argue that experimental verification is over-rated anyway. They say <a href=\"https://www.quantamagazine.org/20151216-physicists-and-philosophers-debate-the-boundaries-of-science/\">we can gauge the validity of a scientific idea by other means</a>, such as whether it rests on sound logic spun from premises that do have observational support.</p><p>Finally, we might make statistical predictions.</p><p>For example, we could use the inflationary multiverse theory to predict which values of the physical constants would be expected in most universes, and then see whether these are close to the ones we see &ndash; on the basis that there is no reason to expect us to be anywhere special in the multiverse.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p03n5prt\"}}</p><p>At any rate, it does seem odd that the multiverse keeps cropping up wherever we look. \"It's proven remarkably hard to write down a theory which produces exactly the universe we see and nothing more,\" says physicist Max Tegmark.</p><blockquote><p> Multiverse theories cannot be tested by looking for those other worlds </p></blockquote><p>Even so, it is not clear that newspaper headlines will announce the discovery of another universe any time soon.

Pretty much every ancient culture came up with its own creation story - most of them leaving the matter in the hands of the gods - and philosophers have written reams on the subject. But science has had little to say about this ultimate question.</p><p>However, in recent years a few physicists and cosmologists have started to tackle it. They point out that we now have an understanding of the history of the universe, and of the physical laws that describe how it works. That information, they say, should give us a clue about how and why the cosmos exists.</p><p>Their admittedly controversial answer is that the entire universe, from the fireball of the Big Bang to the star-studded cosmos we now inhabit, popped into existence from nothing at all. It had to happen, they say, because \"nothing\" is inherently unstable.</p><p>This idea may sound bizarre, or just another fanciful creation story. But the physicists argue that it follows naturally from science's two most powerful and successful theories: quantum mechanics and general relativity.</p><p>Here, then, is how everything could have come from nothing.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p02b3t2n\"}}</p><p><strong>Particles from empty space</strong></p><p>First we have to take a look at the realm of quantum mechanics. This is the branch of physics that deals with very small things: atoms and even tinier particles. It is an immensely successful theory, and it underpins most modern electronic gadgets.</p><p>Quantum mechanics tells us that there is no such thing as empty space. Even the most perfect vacuum is actually filled by a roiling cloud of particles and antiparticles, which flare into existence and almost instantaneously fade back into nothingness.</p><p>These so-called virtual particles don't last long enough to be observed directly, but we know they exist by <a href=\"http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/physics/Quantum/casimir.html\" target=\"_blank\">their effects</a>.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p02b3tyd\"}}</p><p><strong>Space-time, from no space and no time</strong></p><p>From tiny things like atoms, to really big things like galaxies. Our best theory for describing such large-scale structures is general relativity, Albert Einstein's crowning achievement, which sets out how space, time and gravity work.</p><p>Relativity is very different from quantum mechanics, and so far nobody has been able to combine the two seamlessly. However, some theorists have been able to bring the two theories to bear on particular problems by using carefully chosen approximations. For instance, this approach was used by <a href=\"http://www.hawking.org.uk/\" target=\"_blank\">Stephen Hawking</a> at the University of Cambridge to describe black holes.</p><blockquote><p> In quantum physics, if something is not forbidden, it necessarily happens </p></blockquote><p>One thing they have found is that, when quantum theory is applied to space at the smallest possible scale, space itself becomes unstable. Rather than remaining perfectly smooth and continuous, space and time destabilize, churning and frothing into a foam of space-time bubbles.</p><p>In other words, little bubbles of space and time can form spontaneously. \"If space and time are quantized, they can fluctuate,\" says <a href=\"https://physics.asu.edu/people/faculty/lawrence-krauss\" target=\"_blank\">Lawrence Krauss</a> at Arizona State University in Tempe. \"So you can create virtual space-times just as you can create virtual particles.\"</p><p>What's more, if it's possible for these bubbles to form, you can guarantee that they will. \"In quantum physics, if something is not forbidden, it necessarily happens with some non-zero probability,\" says <a href=\"http://cosmos2.phy.tufts.edu/vilenkin.html\" target=\"_blank\">Alexander Vilenkin</a> of Tufts University in Boston, Massachusetts.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p02b3tst\"}}</p><p><strong>A universe from a bubble</strong></p><p>So it's not just particles and antiparticles that can snap in and out of nothingness: bubbles of space-time can do the same. Still, it seems like a big leap from an infinitesimal space-time bubble to a massive universe that hosts 100 billion galaxies. Surely, even if a bubble formed, it would be doomed to disappear again in the blink of an eye?</p><blockquote><p> If all the galaxies are flying apart, they must once have been close together </p></blockquote><p>Actually, it is possible for the bubble to survive. But for that we need another trick: cosmic inflation.</p><p>Most physicists now think that the universe began with the Big Bang. At first all the matter and energy in the universe was crammed together in one unimaginably small dot, and this exploded. This follows from the discovery, in the early 20th century, that the universe is expanding. If all the galaxies are flying apart, they must once have been close together.</p><p>Inflation theory proposes that in the immediate aftermath of the Big Bang, the universe expanded much faster than it did later. This seemingly outlandish notion was put forward in the 1980s by <a href=\"http://web.mit.edu/physics/people/faculty/guth_alan.html\" target=\"_blank\">Alan Guth</a> at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and refined by <a href=\"http://web.stanford.edu/~alinde/\" target=\"_blank\">Andrei Linde</a>, now at Stanford University.</p><blockquote><p> As weird as it seems, inflation fits the facts </p></blockquote><p>The idea is that, a fraction of a second after the Big Bang, the quantum-sized bubble of space expanded stupendously fast. In an incredibly brief moment, it went from being smaller than the nucleus of an atom to the size of a grain of sand. When the expansion finally slowed, the force field that had powered it was transformed into the matter and energy that fill the universe today. Guth calls inflation \"the ultimate free lunch\".</p><p>As weird as it seems, inflation fits the facts rather well. In particular, it neatly explains why the cosmic microwave background, the faint remnant of radiation left over from the Big Bang, is almost perfectly uniform across the sky. If the universe had not expanded so rapidly, we would expect the radiation to be patchier than it is.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p02b3vlw\"}}</p><p><strong>The universe is flat and why that's important</strong></p><p>Inflation also gave cosmologists the measuring tool they needed to determine the underlying geometry of the universe. It turns out this is also crucial for understanding how the cosmos came from nothing.</p><p>Einstein's theory of general relativity tells us that the space-time we live in could take three different forms. It could be as flat as a table top. It could curve back on itself like the surface of a sphere, in which case if you travel far enough in the same direction you would end up back where you started. Alternatively, space-time could curve outward like a saddle. So which is it?</p><p>There is a way to tell. You might remember from maths class that the three angles of a triangle add up to exactly 180 degrees. Actually your teachers left out a crucial point: this is only true on a flat surface. If you draw a triangle on the surface of a balloon, its three angles will add up to more than 180 degrees. Alternatively, if you draw a triangle on a surface that curves outward like a saddle, its angles will add up to less than 180 degrees.</p><p>So to find out if the universe is flat, we need to measure the angles of a really big triangle. That's where inflation comes in. It determined the average size of the warmer and cooler patches in the cosmic microwave background. Those patches were measured in 2003, and that gave astronomers a selection of triangles. As a result, we know that on the largest observable scale our universe is flat.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p02b3w4b\"}}</p><p>It turns out that a flat universe is crucial. That's because only a flat universe is likely to have come from nothing.</p><p>Everything that exists, from stars and galaxies to the light we see them by, must have sprung from somewhere. We already know that particles spring into existence at the quantum level, so we might expect the universe to contain a few odds and ends. But it takes a huge amount of energy to make all those stars and planets.</p><blockquote><p> The energy of matter is exactly balanced by the energy of the gravity the mass creates </p></blockquote><p>Where did the universe get all this energy? Bizarrely, it may not have had to get any. That's because every object in the universe creates gravity, pulling other objects toward it. This balances the energy needed to create the matter in the first place.</p><p>It's a bit like an old-fashioned measuring scale. You can put a heavy weight on one side, so long as it is balanced by an equal weight on the other. In the case of the universe, the matter goes on one side of the scale, and has to be balanced by gravity.</p><p>Physicists have calculated that in a flat universe the energy of matter is exactly balanced by the energy of the gravity the mass creates. But this is only true in a flat universe. If the universe had been curved, the two sums would not cancel out.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p02b3vrq\"}}</p><p><strong>Universe or multiverse?</strong></p><p>At this point, making a universe looks almost easy. Quantum mechanics tells us that \"nothing\" is inherently unstable, so the initial leap from nothing to something may have been inevitable. Then the resulting tiny bubble of space-time could have burgeoned into a massive, busy universe, thanks to inflation. As Krauss puts it, \"The laws of physics as we understand them make it eminently plausible that our universe arose from nothing - no space, no time, no particles, nothing that we now know of.\"</p><p>So why did it only happen once? If one space-time bubble popped into existence and inflated to form our universe, what kept other bubbles from doing the same?</p><blockquote><p> There could be a mind-boggling smorgasbord of universes </p></blockquote><p>Linde offers a simple but mind-bending answer. He thinks universes have always been springing into existence, and that this process will continue forever.</p><p>When a new universe stops inflating, says Linde, it is still surrounded by space that is continuing to inflate. That inflating space can spawn more universes, with yet more inflating space around them. So once inflation starts it should make an endless cascade of universes, which Linde calls eternal inflation. Our universe may be just one grain of sand on an endless beach.</p><p>Those universes might be profoundly different to ours. The universe next door might have five dimensions of space rather than the three &ndash; length, breadth and height &ndash; that ours does. Gravity might be ten times stronger or a thousand times weaker, or not exist at all. Matter might be built out of utterly different particles.</p><p>So there could be a mind-boggling smorgasbord of universes. Linde says eternal inflation is not just the ultimate free lunch: it is the only one at which all possible dishes are available.</p><p>As yet we don't have hard evidence that other universes exist. But either way, these ideas give a whole new meaning to the phrase \"Thanks for nothing\".</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p02b3wrr\"}}</p>","BusinessUnit":"bbc.com","CalloutBody":"","CalloutPosition":"","CalloutSubtitle":"","CalloutTitle":"","Campaign":null,"Collection":[],"DisableAdverts":false,"DisplayDate":"2014-11-06T10:18:39Z","Geolocation":null,"HeadlineLong":"Why is there something rather than nothing?","HeadlineShort":"Why does anything exist at all?","HideRelated":false,"Horizontal":null,"HyperHorizontal":null,"Intro":"Some physicists think they can explain why the universe first formed.

Whatever the circumstances, at some point we all find ourselves confronted with the age-old question: what happens when you fall into a black hole?</p><p>You might expect to get crushed, or maybe torn to pieces. But the reality is stranger than that.</p><p>The instant you entered the black hole, reality would split in two. In one, you would be instantly incinerated, and in the other you would plunge on into the black hole utterly unharmed.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p02rz7kc\"}}</p><p>A black hole is a place where the laws of physics as we know them break down. Einstein taught us that gravity warps space itself, causing it to curve. So given a dense enough object, space-time can become so warped that it twists in on itself, burrowing a hole through the very fabric of reality.</p><p>A massive star that has run out of fuel can produce the kind of extreme density needed to create such a mangled bit of world. As it buckles under its own weight and collapses inward, space-time caves in with it. The gravitational field becomes so strong that not even light can escape, rendering the region where the star used to be profoundly dark: a black hole.</p><blockquote><p> As you go deeper into the black hole, space becomes ever more curvy </p></blockquote><p>The outermost boundary of the hole is its event horizon, the point at which the gravitational force precisely counteracts the light's efforts to escape it. Go closer than this, and there's no escape.</p><p>The event horizon is ablaze with energy. Quantum effects at the edge create streams of hot particles that radiate back out into the universe. This is called Hawking radiation, after the physicist Stephen Hawking, who predicted it. Given enough time, the black hole will radiate away its mass, and vanish.</p><p>As you go deeper into the black hole, space becomes ever more curvy until, at the centre, it becomes infinitely curved. This is the singularity. Space and time cease to be meaningful ideas, and the laws of physics as we know them &mdash; all of which require space and time &mdash; no longer apply.</p><p>What happens here, no one knows. Another universe? Oblivion? <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0816692/\">The back of a bookcase</a>? It's a mystery.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p02rz7lq\"}}</p><p>So what happens if you accidentally fall into one of these cosmic aberrations? Let's start by asking your space companion &mdash; we'll call her Anne &mdash; who watches in horror as you plunge toward the black hole, while she remains safely outside. From where she's floating, things are about to get weird.</p><p>As you accelerate toward the event horizon, Anne sees you stretch and contort, as if she were viewing you through a giant magnifying glass. What's more, the closer you get to the horizon the more you appear to move in slow motion.</p><blockquote><p> Before you ever cross over into the black hole's darkness, you're reduced to ash </p></blockquote><p>You can't shout to her, as there's no air in space, but you might try flashing her a Morse message with the light on your iPhone (there's an app for that). However, your words reach her ever more slowly, the light waves stretching to increasingly lower and redder frequencies: \"Alright, a l r i g h t,&nbsp;&nbsp; a&nbsp;&nbsp; l&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; r&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; i&hellip;\"</p><p>When you reach the horizon, Anne sees you freeze, like someone has hit the pause button. You remain plastered there, motionless, stretched across the surface of the horizon as a growing heat begins to engulf you.</p><p>According to Anne, you are slowly obliterated by the stretching of space, the stopping of time and the fires of Hawking radiation. Before you ever cross over into the black hole's darkness, you're reduced to ash.</p><p>But before we plan your funeral, let's forget about Anne and view this gruesome scene from your point of view. Now, something even stranger happens: nothing.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p02rz7jf\"}}</p><p>You sail straight into nature's most ominous destination without so much as a bump or a jiggle &ndash; and certainly no stretching, slowing or scalding radiation. That's because you're in freefall, and therefore you feel no gravity: something Einstein called his \"happiest thought\".</p><blockquote><p> In a big enough black hole, you could live out the rest of your life pretty normally </p></blockquote><p>After all, the event horizon is not like a brick wall floating in space. It's an artefact of perspective. An observer who remains outside the black hole can't see through it, but that's not your problem. As far as you're concerned there is no horizon.</p><p>Sure, if the black hole were smaller you'd have a problem. The force of gravity would be much stronger at your feet than at your head, stretching you out like a piece of spaghetti. But lucky for you this is a big one, millions of times more massive than our Sun, so the forces that might spaghettify you are feeble enough to be ignored.</p><p>In fact, in a big enough black hole, you could live out the rest of your life pretty normally before dying at the singularity.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p02rz7mc\"}}</p><p>How normal could it really be, you might wonder, given that you're being sucked toward a rupture in the space-time continuum, pulled along against your will, unable to head back the other way?</p><blockquote><p> You can't turn around and escape the black hole </p></blockquote><p>But when you think about it, we all know that feeling, not from our experience with space but with time. <a href=\"http://www.bbc.com/earth/story/20150309-why-does-time-only-run-forwards\">Time only goes forwards, never backwards, and it pulls us along against our will</a>, preventing us from turning around.</p><p>This isn't just an analogy. Black holes warp space and time to such an extreme that inside the black hole's horizon, space and time actually swap roles. In a sense, it really is time that pulls you in toward the singularity. You can't turn around and escape the black hole, any more than you can turn around and travel back to the past.</p><p>At this point you might want to stop and ask yourself a pressing question: What the hell is wrong with Anne? If you're chilling inside the black hole, surrounded by nothing weirder than empty space, why is she insisting that you've been burned to a crisp by radiation outside the horizon? Is she hallucinating?</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p02rz7nb\"}}</p><p>Actually, Anne is being perfectly reasonable. From her point of view, you really have been burned to a crisp at the horizon. It's not an illusion. She could even collect your ashes and send them back to your loved ones.</p><p>In fact, the laws of nature require that you remain outside the black hole as seen from Anne's perspective. That's because quantum physics demands that information can never be lost. Every bit of information that accounts for your existence has to stay on the outside of the horizon, lest Anne's laws of physics be broken.</p><blockquote><p> You have to be in two places, but there can only be one copy of you </p></blockquote><p>On the other hand, the laws of physics also require that you sail through the horizon without encountering hot particles or anything out of the ordinary. Otherwise you'd be in violation of Einstein's happiest thought, and his theory of general relativity.</p><p>So the laws of physics require that you be both outside the black hole in a pile of ashes and inside the black hole alive and well. Last but not least, there's a third law of physics that says information can't be cloned. You have to be in two places, but there can only be one copy of you.</p><p>Somehow, the laws of physics point us towards a conclusion that seems rather nonsensical. Physicists call this infuriating conundrum the black hole information paradox. Luckily, in the 1990s they found a way to resolve it.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p02rz7hw\"}}</p><p><a href=\"http://theoreticalminimum.com/biography\">Leonard Susskind</a> realized that there is no paradox, because no one person ever sees your clone. Anne only sees one copy of you. You only see one copy of you. You and Anne can never compare notes. And there's no third observer who can see both inside and outside a black hole simultaneously. So, no laws of physics are broken.</p><blockquote><p> Reality depends on whom you ask </p></blockquote><p>Unless, that is, you demand to know which story is really true. Are you really dead or are you really alive?</p><p>The great secret that black holes have revealed to us is that there is no really<em>. </em>Reality depends on whom you ask. There is Anne's reality and there is your reality. End of story.</p><p>Well, almost. In the summer of 2012, the physicists Ahmed Almheiri, Donald Marolf, Joe Polchinski and James Sully, collectively known as AMPS, <a href=\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/JHEP02(2013)062\">devised a thought experiment</a> that threatened to upend everything we thought we knew about black holes.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p02rz7hl\"}}</p><p>They realized that Susskind's solution hinged on the fact that any disagreement between you and Anne is mediated by the event horizon. It didn't matter if Anne saw the unlucky version of you scattered amongst the Hawking radiation, because the horizon prevented her from seeing the other version of you floating along inside the black hole.</p><blockquote><p> Anne might sneak a peek behind the horizon </p></blockquote><p>But what if there was a way for her to find out what was on the other side of the horizon, without actually crossing it?</p><p>Ordinary relativity would say that's a no-no, but quantum mechanics makes the rules a little fuzzier. Anne might sneak a peek behind the horizon, using a little trick that Einstein called \"spooky action-at-a-distance\".</p><p>This happens when two sets of particles that are separated in space are mysteriously \"entangled\". They are part of a single, indivisible whole, so that the information needed to describe them can't be found in either set alone, but in the spooky links between them.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p02rz7l0\"}}</p><p>The AMPS idea went something like this. Let's say Anne grabs hold of a bit of information near the horizon &mdash; call it A.</p><blockquote><p> Each bit of information can only be entangled once </p></blockquote><p>If her story is right, and you are a goner, scrambled amongst the Hawking radiation outside the black hole, then A must be entangled with another bit of information, B, which is also part of the hot cloud of radiation.</p><p>On the other hand, if your story is the true one, and you're alive and well on the other side of the event horizon, then A must be entangled with a different bit of information, C, which is somewhere inside the black hole.</p><p>Here's the kicker: each bit of information can only be entangled once. That means A can only be entangled with B or with C, not with both.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p02rzdx6\"}}</p><p>So Anne takes her bit, A, and puts it through her handy entanglement-decoding machine, which spits out an answer: either B or C.</p><blockquote><p> Do you glide right through and live a normal life? </p></blockquote><p>If the answer turns out to be C, then your story wins, but the laws of quantum mechanics are broken. If A is entangled with C, which is deep inside the black hole, then that piece of information is lost to Anne forever. That breaks the quantum law that information can never be lost.</p><p>That leaves B. If Anne's decoding machine finds that A is entangled with B, then Anne wins, and general relativity loses. If A is entangled with B, then Anne's story is the one true story, which means you really were burned to a crisp. Instead of sailing straight through the horizon, as relativity says you should, you hit a burning firewall.</p><p>So we're back where we started: what happens when you fall into a black hole? Do you glide right through and live a normal life, thanks to a reality that's strangely observer-dependent? Or do you approach the black hole's horizon only to collide with a deadly firewall?</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p02rzf13\"}}</p><p>No one knows the answer, and it's become one of the most contentious questions in fundamental physics.</p><blockquote><p> It would take Anne an extraordinarily long time to decode the entanglement </p></blockquote><p>Physicists have spent more than a century <a href=\"http://www.bbc.com/earth/story/20150409-can-science-ever-explain-everything\">trying to reconcile general relativity with quantum mechanics</a>, knowing that eventually one or the other was going to have to give. The solution to the firewall paradox should tell us which, and point the way to an even deeper theory of the universe.</p><p>One clue might lie in Anne's decoding machine. Figuring out which other bit of information A is entangled with is an extraordinarily complicated problem. So physicists <a href=\"https://scholar.google.co.uk/citations?user=lz4HDRwAAAAJ&amp;hl=en\">Daniel Harlow</a> of Princeton University in New Jersey and <a href=\"http://web.stanford.edu/~phayden/\">Patrick Hayden</a>, now at Stanford University in California, wondered how long it would take.</p><p>In 2013 they calculated that, even given the fastest computer that the laws of physics would allow, it would take Anne an extraordinarily long time to decode the entanglement. By the time she had an answer, <a href=\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/JHEP06(2013)085\">the black hole would have long evaporated</a>, disappearing from the universe and taking with it the threat of a deadly firewall.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p02rzf5l\"}}</p><p>If that's the case, the sheer complexity of the problem could prevent Anne from ever figuring out which story is the real one. That would leave both stories simultaneously true, reality intriguingly observer-dependent, all the laws of physics intact, and no one in danger of running into an inexplicable wall of fire.</p><blockquote><p> If the true nature of reality lies hidden somewhere, the best place to look is a black hole </p></blockquote><p>It also gives physicists something new to think about: the tantalizing connections between complex calculations (like the one Anne apparently can't do) and space-time. This may open the door to something deeper still.</p><p>That's the thing about black holes. They're not just annoying obstacles for space travellers. They're also theoretical laboratories that take the subtlest quirks in the laws of physics, then amplify them to such proportions that they can't be ignored.</p><p>If the true nature of reality lies hidden somewhere, the best place to look is a black hole. It's probably best to look from the outside, though: at least until they figure out this whole firewall thing. Or send Anne in. It's her turn already.</p>","BusinessUnit":"bbc.com","CalloutBody":"","CalloutPosition":"","CalloutSubtitle":"","CalloutTitle":"","Campaign":null,"Collection":[],"DisableAdverts":false,"DisplayDate":"2015-05-25T04:56:18Z","Geolocation":null,"HeadlineLong":"The strange fate of a person falling into a black hole","HeadlineShort":"What's it like in a black hole?","HideRelated":false,"Horizontal":null,"HyperHorizontal":null,"Intro":"If you fell into a black hole, you might expect to die instantly.

article has been amended since it was first published</em></p><p>A rock is the ultimate example of inanimate, dead matter. After all, it just sits there, and only moves if it is pushed. But what if some minerals are not as stone-dead as we thought?</p><p>Chemist Graham Cairns-Smith has spent his entire scientific career pushing a simple, radical idea: life did not begin with fiddly organic molecules like DNA, but with simple crystals.</p><p>It is now 50 years since Cairns-Smith first put forward his ideas about the origin of life. Some scientists have ridiculed them; others have, cautiously or wholeheartedly, embraced them. They have never become mainstream orthodoxy, but they have never quite gone away either. Was there any truth to Cairns-Smith's daring proposal? Did life really come from crystals?</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p045mv22\"}}</p><p>In June 2016 I visited Cairns-Smith and his wife Dorothy at their house on the outskirts of Glasgow, UK. Now 85, he has a rare condition related to Parkinson's disease, which has affected his mobility. However, his scientific curiosity and his sense of humour remain undimmed.</p><blockquote><p> He was a dour man and he sort of muttered, 'A pity you chose science' </p></blockquote><p>While he will most likely be remembered for his theories on the origin of life, his first passion was painting.</p><p>\"We met when he was at Glasgow and he was doing these,\" says Dorothy, showing me the prolific collection lining almost every wall in the downstairs of their house. \"He was going through an abstract phase.\"&nbsp;</p><p>Cairns-Smith's success as a painter eventually became too demanding. He was putting on one-man shows and getting paintings into the Royal Scottish Academy, but decided to quit and focus on science, which offered a more reliable income with which to support a family.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p045mvcd\"}}</p><p>\"There was a man called <a href=\"http://www.scottish-gallery.co.uk/artist/william_crosbie\">William Crosbie</a>, who was a very well-known Scottish painter, who was teaching him [at Glasgow],\" Dorothy recalls. \"He was a dour man and he sort of muttered, 'A pity you chose science'.\"</p><p>However, Cairns-Smith does not seem to have any regrets about his decision. Copies of his scientific books, and the sketches he drew to illustrate them, are spread across his upstairs study. They have just as much of a presence in the house as his artwork.</p><p>As a student at the University of Edinburgh in the 1950s, Cairns-Smith became fascinated by the problem of how life began.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p045mts0\"}}</p><p>Through his studies of organic chemistry, Cairns-Smith understood that the essential molecules of life &ndash; such as DNA and proteins &ndash; could be delicate and temperamental. So how could complex molecules like these spring from the soup of simple compounds on the primordial Earth? This puzzle still occupies scientists today.</p><blockquote><p> To Cairns-Smith, the experiment raised more questions than it answered </p></blockquote><p>In a study published in 1953 &ndash; the same year that the structure of DNA was discovered &ndash; a biochemist called Stanley Miller sent a bolt of electricity through a mixture of gases and liquids thought to have been present on the early Earth. The spark turned these simple chemicals into some of the most basic building blocks of life: amino acids, the units that link together to make proteins.</p><p>The story hit the headlines. \"<a href=\"http://content.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,890596,00.html\">Science: Semi-creation</a>\" was the headline in <em>Time</em> magazine. Miller's <a href=\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1126/science.117.3046.528\">study</a> became a landmark scientific paper.</p><p>But to Cairns-Smith, the experiment raised more questions than it answered.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p045mtr5\"}}</p><p>Although Miller had made some of the most essential compounds of life, his experiment did not explain how they and other building blocks &ndash; such as nucleotides, which make up DNA &ndash; first came together in an ordered way, to form the complex molecules necessary for life.</p><blockquote><p> His aim was to find a system much simpler than modern life </p></blockquote><p>In Miller's experiment, \"simpler molecules are more likely to be found and more likely to form than more complex molecules,\" says Cairns-Smith. \"The idea you'd make a nucleotide is ridiculous. The more complicated the molecule, the less of it will form.\"</p><p>For Cairns-Smith, this was the real problem. He thought there had to be another stage before our elaborate system of genetic material took over.</p><p>\"It was an extremely interesting experiment,\" says Cairns-Smith. He also describes it as \"beautiful\". But it did not satisfy his curiosity.</p><p>So he decided to go back to basics.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p045mvfj\"}}</p><p>Cairns-Smith asked himself two questions: What are the essential properties needed for a living system, and can those properties be found anywhere other than the forms of life that we know today?</p><blockquote><p> If you look at clay under a microscope, you will find that it is made of tiny crystals </p></blockquote><p>His aim was to find a system much simpler than modern life, but which had some of the crucial properties of a living system. He found an answer in an unlikely place: clays.</p><p>Most of us, if we think about clay at all, probably just remember how bad we were in pottery class at school. Clay, at first glance, is just a sort of damp, vaguely gritty dirt.</p><p>But Cairns-Smith knew there was more to clay than that. In an abstract way, it can be rather life-like.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p045mxg8\"}}</p><p>If you look at clay under a microscope, you will find that it is made of tiny crystals. Within each crystal, atoms are arranged in a structure that repeats in a tightly-packed, regular pattern.</p><blockquote><p> Crystals' essential characteristics mean they are primed to begin evolving </p></blockquote><p>Each crystal can grow, if it is placed in water laced with the same chemical components. Crystals can also split apart, with one \"mother\" crystal giving rise to \"daughter\" crystals.</p><p>Each crystal can even have its own peculiarities, which it can pass on to its daughter crystals &ndash; much like living things inherit traits from their parents. And sometimes, when a crystal breaks apart, new quirks can be introduced, for instance because of the stress of breaking. This is similar to the process of genetic mutation, which creates new traits in living things.</p><p>In other words, Cairns-Smith reasoned, crystals' essential characteristics mean they are primed to begin evolving.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p045mv1r\"}}</p><p>When a crystal passes its peculiarities onto its daughters, these unique traits could either help or hinder the new crystals.</p><p>For instance, the daughters may end up more likely to be able to split into two crystals. If the characteristics of a crystal affect its ability to split apart, then in effect that crystal has an evolutionary advantage.</p><blockquote><p> In 50 years there have only been a handful of experiments exploring Cairns-Smith's ideas </p></blockquote><p>In a sense, physical flaws or peculiarities in a crystal could be thought of as genetic information. As a result, Cairns-Smith thought that crystal minerals could be subject to a simple form of evolution by natural selection. This idea is now called the \"crystals-as-genes hypothesis\".</p><p>At a later stage, Cairns-Smith reasoned, biological molecules like DNA began to associate with the crystals. This helped the replication process. Eventually, a \"genetic takeover\" happened: the biological molecules developed the ability to replicate by themselves, and left the crystals behind.</p><p>Cairns-Smith set all this out in <a href=\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0022-5193(66)90178-0\">a paper published in 1966</a>, half a century ago.</p><p>His ideas are elegant, but there is a big problem: they have proved almost impossible to test. In 50 years there have only been a handful of experiments exploring Cairns-Smith's ideas.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p045mthp\"}}</p><p>The trouble is that there is no experimental technique for studying minerals at the tiny scales necessary to examine the processes Cairns-Smith outlined, says <a href=\"http://www.biosystems.physik.lmu.de/\">Dieter Braun</a> of Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich in Germany.</p><blockquote><p> I fell in love with the book because it was so unlike a typical scientific monograph </p></blockquote><p>Researchers would have to minutely examine nanoscale crystals, underwater, over a period of days to monitor how they behave. \"That's just technologically very difficult,\" Braun says.</p><p>He says we would need something analogous to genetic sequencing, the method by which researchers \"read\" the letters of DNA that make up the human genome. \"You know, it took us 40 years to get sequencing for a molecule like DNA really working fast,\" says Braun.</p><p>Braun adds that geneticists had a powerful motivation to perfect DNA sequencing: it promised new medical treatments. Studying clay crystals would be equally difficult and expensive, with no practical benefit.</p><p>Even so, at least one element of Cairns-Smith's hypothesis has been put to the test.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p045mtp0\"}}</p><p><a href=\"http://kahrresearch.com/\">Bart Kahr</a> is a crystallographer at New York University in the US. He first discovered Cairns-Smith's ideas when he came across one of his books in a shop in the mid-1980s.</p><blockquote><p> He wanted to track how mother crystals pass on their traits to daughter crystals </p></blockquote><p>\"I fell in love with the book because it was so unlike a typical scientific monograph,\" says Kahr. \"It was so impossibly rich [in] genuinely new ideas, and it was written in a kind of a literary vein, almost.\"</p><p>The next time Kahr saw the idea mentioned was in the mid-2000s &ndash; when it was harshly criticised.</p><p>\"I was astonished that, 25 years on, people would still invoke the crystals-as-genes theory, only to knock it down by instantly saying that there's not any evidence for it whatsoever,\" says Kahr. \"It was like a persistent straw man, that everybody felt that they had to acknowledge, but only to then pejoratively dismiss it as not ever having been tested.\"</p><p>Kahr decided to test it in his lab. He wanted to track how mother crystals pass on their traits to daughter crystals, to find out whether inheritance might work in clay minerals.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p045mv4z\"}}</p><p>He decided to focus on a set of crystal traits called \"screw dislocations\". These are columns running throughout the crystal, where part of it has been nudged slightly out of alignment. Dislocations come about through the process of crystal growth, and the pattern of dislocations throughout a crystal can form a unique pattern.</p><blockquote><p> Clays are just lousy crystals </p></blockquote><p>Cairns-Smith had likened these irregularities to the holes in old-fashioned computer punch cards. In the same way, he supposed that these dislocations could act as a store of information.</p><p>Kahr wanted to test whether this pattern of dislocations would be inherited by the daughter crystal, and how many mutations &ndash; new dislocations &ndash; would be introduced when a daughter crystal broke off.</p><p>To avoid some of the experimental difficulties that Braun foresaw, Kahr used crystals of potassium hydrogen phthalate, which were easier to work with than clay. \"Clays are just lousy crystals,\" he says.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p045mtvg\"}}</p><p>Kahr and his team developed a technique to map the screw dislocations of mother and daughter phthalate crystals. They found that they could see the dislocations mapping on from mother to daughter crystal quite neatly. <a href=\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1039/B616612C\">The results were published in 2007</a>.</p><blockquote><p> Fewer mutations would have been \"more like life as we know it now\" </p></blockquote><p>However, they were surprised by just how many additional defects appeared in the daughter crystals after they had broken off. The daughter crystals were riddled with these \"mutations\", and typically had at least as many new dislocations as inherited ones.</p><p>That was a problem for Cairns-Smith's ideas. If the crystals were to gradually evolve, there needed to be more inheritance than mutation, so that mothers could have a strong effect on their daughters' pattern of dislocations.</p><p>\"For this to be a convincing demonstration, you can't go from a frog to a monkey in a single generation,\" he says. Fewer mutations would have been \"more like life as we know it now\".</p><p>However, Kahr is not the only one to have explored Cairns-Smith's ideas.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p045mtzl\"}}</p><p><a href=\"http://schulmanlab.jhu.edu/\">Rebecca Schulman</a>, a bio-engineer at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, Maryland, was also inspired by the crystals-as-genes hypothesis.</p><blockquote><p> She had found a way to represent and copy information, in crystal form </p></blockquote><p>In a series of experiments published over the last decade, she has designed a system where information is coded in a crystal structure. Rather than using naturally-occurring minerals, Schulman used crystals of nanometre-scale tiles that were made of DNA.</p><p>This DNA did not carry information in the way that it usually does in our cells. Instead, Schulman used it like Velcro to stick the tiles together in a crystal structure. It was the order of the tiles that encoded the information.</p><p>\"If we could build any kind of crystal based on the very simple physical rules that we know crystals must obey, then it's possible to imagine interesting evolution processes that could emerge in relatively simple environments,\" she says.</p><p>Schulman found, first through <a href=\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1137/070680266\">computer simulation</a> and then by <a href=\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1117813109\">experiment</a>, that the DNA tiles could stack up in a particular pattern, effectively encoding information in a crystal structure. She had found a way to represent and copy information, in crystal form.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p045mv8t\"}}</p><p>On a theoretical level, her findings are useful for studies of the origin of life. \"Part of the goal for origin-of-life research is very broadly to ask how one can design systems in chemistry where information can be replicated,\" says Schulman.</p><blockquote><p> He could never get funding </p></blockquote><p>However, Schulman's studies do not show that Cairns-Smith's theory is correct. For one thing, her experiments did not use clay. More broadly, just because the process works in the lab does not necessarily imply that life on Earth really began that way.</p><p>That is about it for rigorous experimental tests of the crystals-as-genes idea. Cairns-Smith himself tried for years to put his ideas to the test, but made little headway.</p><p>\"He could never get funding,\" Dorothy says. A major stumbling block to securing research grants was that his work straddled too many different disciplines.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p045mtkf\"}}</p><p>\"One time we went to California, and Graham gave lectures to the Menlo Park Geology Survey,\" says Dorothy. \"They all said, well, your geology's fine but I don't think your chemistry's right. Then he gave a lecture to NASA on the chemistry side and they said, well, your chemistry's fine but I'm not sure about your biology. And then he lectured to Berkeley and they said, well, your biology's fine but I'm not sure about your geology.\"</p><blockquote><p> I was supremely disappointed by people who think that more complicated ideas are more likely to be true </p></blockquote><p>Cairns-Smith found a more eager audience in science journalists and the popular press. Other scientists showed interest, too: the evolutionary biologist and writer Richard Dawkins discussed the crystals-as-genes hypothesis in his 1986 book <em>The Blind Watchmaker</em>.</p><p>Eventually Cairns-Smith's publisher encouraged him to write a popular science book on his ideas. Entitled <a href=\"http://www.cambridge.org/us/academic/subjects/life-sciences/evolutionary-biology/seven-clues-origin-life-scientific-detective-story\"><em>Seven Clues to the Origin of Life</em></a>, it was published in 1990. Written in the style of a murder mystery, it is about as gripping as a book on organic chemistry can get.</p><p>Cairns-Smith says he enjoyed writing for wider audiences, because putting a point simply and intuitively held a satisfaction for him. \"I was supremely disappointed by people who think that more complicated ideas are more likely to be true,\" he says.</p><p>But despite his best efforts, his ideas did not enter the scientific mainstream.</p><p>\"I'm puzzled generally speaking at why some things in science seem to catch on and others seem not to catch on,\" says Kahr. \"There's no accounting for popular taste.\"</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p045mxg8\"}}</p><p>But even if Cairns-Smith's specific ideas never pan out, there are two ways in which they continue to influence the science of the origin of life even today.</p><blockquote><p> Until now, origin of life research was really chemistry-dominated </p></blockquote><p>The first is that they raise the question of what constitutes life, and offer a way in which life-like processes can arise without familiar molecules like DNA.</p><p>\"It's a good idea to look around beyond what biology is really teaching us,\" says Braun. \"Why not scope out the possibilities quite widely? I'm all in for that.\"</p><p>Secondly, Cairns-Smith's multidisciplinary approach &ndash; fusing biology, chemistry and geology &ndash; was way ahead of its time.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p045mtt8\"}}</p><p>\"Until now, origin of life research was really chemistry-dominated,\" says Braun. But in the last couple of decades, it has become broader: as well as trying to make the key chemicals of life, researchers are also using genetics to work out what the earliest life was like, and using geology to figure out the conditions in which it formed.</p><blockquote><p> The specific scenario he envisaged may well be completely wrong </p></blockquote><p>\"I guess people will still see it as a little bit of an oddity, but he was really pointing us in the right direction,\" says Braun. \"People now realise that life is not arising just in water in a glass flask, but in all the chemistry of the environment and from geology. That's his legacy: to say, look in more detail at rocks.\"</p><p>There may never be hard evidence for Cairns-Smith's ideas. \"If this were to be a huge scientific enterprise, if there were huge technology behind it, there would be enough resources to really push the experiments,\" says Braun. \"But it's really just a very small community, and this is a little bit too far out.\"</p><p>However, the lack of evidence will not be Cairns-Smith's real legacy. The specific scenario he envisaged may well be completely wrong. But in terms of inspiring people to look at the question of life's origin in new ways, his work has punched well above its weight.</p><p><em><strong>Update 30 August 2016:</strong> Since this article was published we have learned that Graham Cairns-Smith died on 26 August 2016</em></p><p><em>Join over five million BBC Earth fans by liking us on <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/bbcearth\" target=\"_blank\">Facebook</a>, or follow us on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/bbcearth\" target=\"_blank\">Twitter</a> and <a href=\"https://instagram.com/bbcearth/\" target=\"_blank\">Instagram</a>.</em></p><p><em>If you liked this story, <a href=\"http://pages.emails.bbc.com/subscribe/?ocid=ear.bbc.email.we.email-signup\" target=\"_blank\">sign up for the weekly bbc.com features newsletter</a> called \"If You Only Read 6 Things This Week\".

We probably need to imagine something literally a bit more solid.</p><p>While we cannot be sure that all life is carbon-based, as it is on Earth, there are good reasons to think that it is likely. Carbon is much more versatile as a building block for complex molecules than, say, silicon, the favourite element for speculations about alternative alien biochemistries.</p><p>Astrobiologist <a href=\"http://www.ph.ed.ac.uk/people/charles-cockell\">Charles Cockell</a> at the University of Edinburgh in the UK thinks that the broad basis of life on Earth &ndash; that it is carbon-based and requires water &ndash; \"reflects a universal norm\". He concedes that \"I have a quite conservative view, which science generally proves is misguided.\" But still, for now let's stick with carbon-based life. How could it be generated in outer space?</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p03rv86m\"}}</p><p>The basic chemistry is not a problem. As well as sugars, life on Earth needed amino acids, the building blocks of proteins. But we know that these can be formed in outer space too, because they have been found in \"primitive\" meteorites that have never seen a planetary surface.</p><blockquote><p> Some chemicals could react even when chilled to just four degrees above absolute zero </p></blockquote><p>They might be made on icy grains from some variation of a chemical reaction called the <a href=\"http://www.organic-chemistry.org/namedreactions/strecker-synthesis.shtm\">Strecker synthesis</a>, after the 19th-Century German chemist who discovered it. The reaction involves simple organic molecules called ketones or aldehydes, which combine with hydrogen cyanide and ammonia. Alternatively, light-driven chemistry triggered by ultraviolet light will do the job.</p><p>It looks at first as though these reactions should not take place in deepest space, without a source of heat or light to drive them. Molecules encountering one another in frigid, dark conditions do not have enough energy to get a chemical reaction started. It is as if they run into a barrier that is too high for them to jump over.</p><p>However, in the 1970s the Soviet chemist Vitali Goldanski showed otherwise. <a href=\"https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg21328481-600-impossible-chemistry-quantum-escape-tunnel/\">Some chemicals could react</a> even when chilled to just four degrees above absolute zero, which is about as cold as space gets. They just needed a bit of help from high-energy radiation such as gamma-rays or electron beams &ndash; like the cosmic rays that whizz through all of space.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p03rv857\"}}</p><p>Under these conditions, Goldanski found that the carbon-based molecule formaldehyde, which is common in molecular clouds, could link up into polymer chains several hundred molecules long.</p><p>Goldanski believed that such space-based reactions might have helped the molecular building blocks of life assemble from simple ingredients like hydrogen cyanide, ammonia and water.</p><blockquote><p> Generally I think these environments aren't very conducive to very complex molecules </p></blockquote><p>But it is far more difficult to coax such molecules to combine into more complex forms. The high-energy radiation that might help get the first reactions started then becomes a problem.</p><p>Ultraviolet and other forms of radiation can induce reactions like those Meinert demonstrated. But Cockell says they are just as likely to smash molecules as they are to form them. Potential biomolecules &ndash; progenitors of proteins and RNA, say &ndash; would be broken apart faster than they were being produced.</p><p>\"Ultimately the question is whether other completely alien environments would give rise to self-replicating chemical systems that can evolve,\" says Cockell. \"I don't see why that wouldn't happen in very cold environments or on the surfaces of ice grains, but generally I think these environments aren't very conducive to very complex molecules.\"</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p03rv80b\"}}</p><p>Planets offer two much gentler energy sources: heat and light. Life on Earth is largely powered by sunlight, and it is a fair bet that life on \"exoplanets\" around other stars would draw on the energy reserves of their own suns.</p><blockquote><p> Galaxies might be full of \"rogue planets\" floating beyond the outermost reaches of a stellar neighbourhood </p></blockquote><p>Vital heat can also come from elsewhere. Some scientists believe that the first life on Earth was not powered by sunlight, but by volcanic energy released from the planet's interior at hot vents in the deep sea. Even today, these vents still spew out a warm, mineral-rich brew.</p><p>There is also heat in Jupiter's major moons. This comes from the huge tidal forces exerted by the giant planet, which squeeze the interiors of the moons and heat them up through friction. This tidal energy keeps the sub-surfaces of the icy moons <a href=\"http://www.bbc.com/earth/story/20150326-europa-may-be-home-to-alien-life\">Europa</a> and <a href=\"http://www.nasa.gov/press/2015/march/nasa-s-hubble-observations-suggest-underground-ocean-on-jupiters-largest-moon\">Ganymede</a> melted into oceans, and <a href=\"http://www.bbc.com/earth/story/20150708-the-volcanoes-found-in-space\">makes Io's surface fiery and volcanic</a>.</p><p>It is hard to see how molecules clinging to icy grains in interstellar space could find any such nurturing energy. But that might not be the only option out there.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p03rv8gm\"}}</p><p>In 1999, planetary scientist <a href=\"https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=IBr9A7oAAAAJ&amp;hl=en\">David Stevenson</a> of the California Institute of Technology <a href=\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/21811\">proposed</a> that galaxies might be full of \"rogue planets\" floating beyond the outermost reaches of a stellar neighbourhood, too far from their \"parent\" star to feel its gravity, heat or light.</p><blockquote><p> These rogue planets might be \"the most common sites of life in the Universe\" </p></blockquote><p>These worlds, Stevenson said, could have formed like any other regular planet, close to a nascent star and within its surrounding nebula of gas and dust.</p><p>But then the gravitational tug of large planets, like our own Jupiter and Saturn, could sling some planets on \"escape trajectories\", propelling them off beyond their solar system into the empty space between stars.</p><p>That might seem to consign them to a cold and barren future. Yet Stevenson argued that, on the contrary, these rogue planets might be \"the most common sites of life in the Universe\" &ndash; because they might stay warm enough to support liquid water under, as it were, their own steam.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p03rv8cv\"}}</p><p>All of the rocky planets in the inner solar system come with two internal heat sources.</p><p>First, each planet has a fiery core still hot from the primordial fury of its formation. On top of that, they contain radioactive elements. These warm up the interior of the planet with their decay, just as a lump of uranium is warm to the touch. On Earth, radioactive decay inside the mantle contributes about half of the total heating.</p><blockquote><p> Rogue planets would not be plagued by giant meteorite impacts </p></blockquote><p>Primordial heat and radioactive decay inside rocky rogue planets could warm them for billions of years &ndash; perhaps enough to keep the planets volcanically active and provide the energy for life to start.</p><p>Rogue planets could also have dense, heat-retaining atmospheres. Compared with gas giants like Jupiter and Saturn, Earth's atmosphere is thin and tenuous, because the Sun's heat and light have stripped away lighter gases like hydrogen. Mercury is so close to the Sun that it barely has any atmosphere at all.</p><p>Yet on an Earth-sized rogue planet, far beyond its parent star's influence, much of the original atmosphere might remain in place. Stevenson estimated that the resulting temperature and pressure could be enough to sustain liquid water at the surface, even without any sunlight.</p><p>What's more, rogue planets would not be plagued by giant meteorite impacts, <a href=\"http://www.bbc.com/earth/story/20160415-what-really-happened-when-the-dino-killer-asteroid-struck\">as Earth has been</a>. They might even be ejected from their native solar system with moons in tow, giving them the benefit of some heating by tidal forces.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p03rv818\"}}</p><p>Even if a rogue planet did not have a thick atmosphere, it could still be habitable.</p><blockquote><p> Any life in this strange habitat would exist like a lone wolf wandering the galactic steppe </p></blockquote><p>In 2011, planetary scientist <a href=\"https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=UqDnxT0AAAAJ\">Dorian Abbot</a> and astrophysicist <a href=\"http://science.gsfc.nasa.gov/sed/bio/eric.r.switzer\">Eric Switzer</a> at the University of Chicago <a href=\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1088/2041-8205/735/2/L27\">calculated</a> that planets about three and a half times the size of the Earth could become covered over with a thick layer of ice. This would insulate an ocean of liquid water many kilometres below the surface, heated by its interior.</p><p>\"The total biological activity would be lower than on a planet like Earth, but you should still be able to have something,\" says Abbot.</p><p>He hopes that <a href=\"http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/missions/europa-mission/\">when space probes investigate the subsurface oceans of Jupiter's icy moons</a> in the coming decades, we will learn more about the possibilities of life on iced-over rogue planets.</p><p>Abbot and Switzer called these orphaned worlds \"Steppenwolf planets\", because, they say, \"any life in this strange habitat would exist like a lone wolf wandering the galactic steppe\". The habitable lifetime of such a planet could be up to ten billion years or so, <a href=\"http://www.bbc.com/earth/story/20150323-how-long-will-life-on-earth-last\">similar to that of Earth</a>, says Abbot.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p03rv8bh\"}}</p><p>If these ideas are right, then outside our solar system rogue planets in interstellar space could be the closest places where extraterrestrial life exists.</p><blockquote><p> Imagine bathing in warm volcanic springs under perpetual night, like a winter vacation in Iceland </p></blockquote><p>They would be very hard to spot at such a distance, being dark and relatively tiny.</p><p>But with luck, say Abbot and Switzer, such a planet passing within about a thousand times the Earth-Sun distance could just about be discerned from the small amount of sunlight it would reflect and the infrared radiation of its own warmth. We might hope to see it with the telescopes currently used to look for exoplanets around other stars.</p><p>If life can originate and survive on an interstellar Steppenwolf planet, say Abbot and Switzer, there is a profound implication: life \"must be truly ubiquitous in the Universe\".</p><p>It would be a strange kind of life on these interstellar worlds. Imagine bathing in warm volcanic springs under perpetual night, like a winter vacation in Iceland.

The event obliterated perhaps 85% of all species living on land - and 95% of all ocean-dwelling species.</p><blockquote><p> Lava smothered an area eight times the size of the UK </p></blockquote><p>No one is quite sure what happened, but it seems to be no coincidence that the extinction coincided with volcanic activity on a truly apocalyptic scale. <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/news/science/risk-of-supervolcano-eruption-big-enough-to-affect-the-world-far-greater-than-thought-say-scientists-9040073.html\">Today we worry about the destructive power of supervolcanoes like Yellowstone</a>. But the damage they might bring is nothing compared to what happened 250 million years ago.</p><p>Back then, Siberia experienced such a large and sustained period of activity that lava smothered an area eight times the size of the UK. Volcanic activity on that scale is rare, but not unheard of.</p><p>No one knows when the next such episode will happen, says <a href=\"https://henriksvensen.wordpress.com/\">Henrik Svensen</a> at the University of Oslo in Norway. Similar-sized eruptions happened 200, 180 and 65 million years ago, so they're not terribly regular. But one will surely happen eventually, and when it does the key question will be where it goes off.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p02m8fpl\"}}</p><p>Svensen's research suggests that a mega-eruption's ability to wipe out species will depend on exactly where it punches through Earth's crust. That's because the volcanic activity 250 million years ago might not have been directly responsible for the massive extinction. The killer ingredient might have been salt.</p><blockquote><p> It's unlikely that life itself would disappear </p></blockquote><p>Siberia is rich in salt deposits. When they were baked by the volcanic activity, Svensen thinks they released vast quantities of ozone-destroying chemicals into the atmosphere. Species all over the world then had to <a href=\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.0404472101\">cope with harmful radiation from space that atmospheric ozone normally soaks up</a>. The stress might well have killed most of them.</p><p>The bad news is that there are <a href=\"http://www.geoexpro.com/articles/2008/05/salt-s-effects-on-petroleum-systems\">plenty of massive salt deposits on Earth today</a>. \"East Siberia is still among the largest reservoirs,\" says Svensen. \"Offshore Brazil is also big.\"</p><p>If a mega-eruption formed in one of these areas, many species would die. But it's unlikely that life itself would disappear. After all, while plants and animals fared poorly during the end-Permian extinction, <a href=\"http://www.newscientist.com/article/mg19726421.900-mass-extinctions-the-microbes-strike-back.html\">single-celled organisms like bacteria sailed through virtually unharmed</a>.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p02m8fs2\"}}</p><p><strong>Asteroid threat</strong></p><p><strong>Timeframe: </strong>within 450 million years, maybe?</p><p>It's common knowledge these days that <a href=\"http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2014/05/140512-asteroid-impact-winter-science/\">asteroids and dinosaurs don't get along</a>. If a massive asteroid could contribute to the extinction of all of the world's large dinosaurs, could one also wipe out all life on Earth?</p><p>Again, that might depend on exactly where the rock lands. We know that the Earth has been hit by some very large asteroids that have barely registered as life destroyers.</p><blockquote><p> Impacts on the scale of the dinosaur killer are rare </p></blockquote><p>The Manicouagan crater in Canada - one of the largest impact craters on the planet - was created in a destructive impact about 215 million years ago. But the fossil record shows <a href=\"http://www.newscientist.com/article/mg19626330.400-mass-extinctions-the-armageddon-factor.html#.VPixbEJ3uCQ\">it didn't trigger a dinosaur-scale extinction</a>. That might be because the crater formed in relatively inert crystalline rock. Craters that form in volatile-rich sedimentary rocks, in contrast, <a href=\"http://www.economist.com/news/science-and-technology/21582243-biggest-extinction-history-was-probably-caused-space-rock-changed\">might send clouds of climate-changing gases into the atmosphere</a>, triggering global mass extinctions.</p><p>The good news is that impacts on the scale of the dinosaur killer are rare. Such big rocks may only strike Earth once every 500 million years.</p><p>But even if one does come along, mass extinction is unlikely to become mass sterilisation. That would probably only be possible if Earth was hit by something even bigger than an asteroid: a rogue planet.</p><p>There might be a precedent for that. Some scientists think Earth was clobbered by a rogue planet soon after it formed, and that the resulting cloud of debris formed the Moon. \"We can call this the Melancholia hypothesis, after <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1527186\">Lars Von Trier's movie</a>,\" says Svensen. Still, this possibility seems pretty remote.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p02m8fxk\"}}</p><p><strong>When the core freezes over</strong></p><p><strong>Timeframe:</strong> 3 to 4 billion years</p><p>While we're on the subject of movies, consider 2003's <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0298814/?ref_=nv_sr_1\"><em>The Core</em></a>. The story is that Earth's core has mysteriously stopped rotating, so the US government backs a plan to drill to the centre of the Earth and restart it &ndash; because without an active core, Earth loses its magnetic field and all life is threatened.</p><blockquote><p> Mars once had, and then lost, a magnetic field </p></blockquote><p><em>The Core</em> is mostly nonsense and has been rightly derided by scientists. But not all of the science it features is junk. Some researchers really do think that Earth's magnetic field deflects ionising particles from the sun, which would otherwise wear away Earth's atmosphere. If they are right, then without a magnetic field our planet will lose its atmosphere too, and all life will die.</p><p>Something like this may have happened on Mars, which may once have been more hospitable to life than it is now.</p><p>In 1997, <a href=\"http://web.gps.caltech.edu/~jkirschvink/\">Joseph Kirschvink</a> at the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena and his colleagues found good evidence that <a href=\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1126/science.275.5306.1629\">Mars once had, and then lost, a magnetic field</a>. \"The Martian magnetosphere collapsed sometime after 3.7 billion years ago, which is about the time that the planet went into a permanent snowball state,\" says Kirschvink.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p02m8fjw\"}}</p><p>You may have heard that <a href=\"http://www.esa.int/Our_Activities/Observing_the_Earth/Swarm/Swarm_reveals_Earth_s_changing_magnetism\">Earth's magnetic field is weakening</a>. But don't worry: that's because <a href=\"http://www.bbc.com/earth/story/20141110-earths-magnetic-field-flips-more\">the magnetic field is in the process of flipping direction</a>, not dying. These flips have happened periodically for millions of years.</p><blockquote><p> Could Earth's magnetic field eventually disappear? </p></blockquote><p>\"If the field reverses, this doesn't mean that it dies out completely,\" says <a href=\"http://www.liv.ac.uk/environmental-sciences/staff/richard-holme/\">Richard Holme</a> at the University of Liverpool in the UK. The flip might well do odd things to the magnetic field but \"wouldn't greatly disrupt life\", he says.</p><p>Could Earth's magnetic field eventually disappear? Not any time soon, says <a href=\"http://www.esc.cam.ac.uk/people/academic-staff/richard-harrison\">Richard Harrison</a> at the University of Cambridge in the UK.</p><p>For that to happen the core would have to completely solidify.

But as we've already seen, even if some of them did eventually hit our planet, they probably wouldn't destroy all life.</p><p>In theory, things could get hairy if a larger rogue star went supernova as it passed through the Oort cloud, sending gamma rays into the inner solar system. \"The nearer the supernova, the most intense [the ionising radiation] is. Ten times nearer, 100 times more intense,\" says Bailer-Jones. \"It could be severe enough to cause real harm.\" But the chances of that \"perfect storm\" occurring are slim, he says.</p><p>A rogue star would also be more dangerous if it passed through the inner parts of the solar system, where the planets are found. But this is again unlikely. \"No star we know of has anything but an extremely small probability of entering the inner solar system,\" says Bailer-Jones. It's too small a target: the distance from the Earth to the Sun is around 50,000 times smaller than the distance to the edge of the Oort cloud.</p><blockquote><p> There are almost certainly organisms that could survive nearly any cataclysm </p></blockquote><p>Researchers can hypothesise almost no end of threats to life on Earth. February 2015 was evidently apocalypse month: <a href=\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/mnras/stu2708\">another study suggested that we should even worry about the mysterious \"dark matter\" in our galaxy</a>. We really shouldn't, says Mamajek, given how little we actually know about dark matter. \"We don't know what the dark matter particles are, and we don't know how and if they would annihilate to generate energy,\" he says.</p><p>In fact, the take-home message from all of this research is that there isn't a plausible catastrophic agent from outside the solar system that could wipe out life on Earth within the next few billion years. \"There are almost certainly organisms that could survive nearly any cataclysm,\" says Mamajek.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p02m8fzx\"}}</p><p><strong>There is nothing to fear but life itself</strong></p><p><strong>Timeframe: </strong>500 million years</p><p>But there is one agent of destruction that certainly is powerful enough to wipe out swathes of species. Life's biggest threat could come from within, according to <a href=\"http://www.ess.washington.edu/dwp/people/profile.php?name=ward--peter\">Peter Ward</a> at the University of Washington in Seattle.</p><blockquote><p> The microbes living on Earth could not cope, and a massive extinction followed </p></blockquote><p>He calls the idea the <a href=\"http://www.newscientist.com/article/mg20227131.400-gaias-evil-twin-is-life-its-own-worst-enemy.html\">Medea hypothesis</a>. The name is a nod to the famous Gaia hypothesis, named for the Greek goddess of the Earth, which suggests that life helps keep Earth habitable. Medea, in stark contrast, is a Greek mythological figure famous for killing her own children. Ward argues that many of the mass extinctions in Earth's history were caused by life.</p><p>For instance, about 2.3 billion years ago lots of oxygen was released into the atmosphere by new forms of photosynthetic life. There had never before been free oxygen, so the microbes living on Earth could not cope with it, and a <a href=\"http://www.slate.com/blogs/bad_astronomy/2014/07/28/the_great_oxygenation_event_the_earth_s_first_mass_extinction.html\">massive extinction followed</a>.</p><p>Then there were the first land plants, about 450 million years ago. Plant roots broke up bedrock into soil, speeding up the chemical reaction between minerals in those rocks and carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. This stripped carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and weakened the greenhouse effect, triggering a lethal ice age.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p02m8g4v\"}}</p><p>Fast-forward into Earth's distant future, and these kinds of effects could sterilise the planet, says Ward. The sun is getting hotter as it ages, and as a consequence the Earth will warm up. That means the chemical reaction between rocks and atmospheric carbon dioxide will speed up &ndash; a process that's accelerated even more by the action of plant roots.</p><blockquote><p> Alien forensic scientists might well conclude that life on Earth had a hand in its own demise </p></blockquote><p>Eventually, so much carbon dioxide will have been removed from the air that plants can no longer perform photosynthesis. All plants will die, and animal life won't be far behind. This could happen surprisingly soon, says Ward, perhaps in just 500 million years.</p><p>There would still be microbes, but they'd be vulnerable. \"When you're down to a few microbes and you don't have a strong system, that's when physical perturbations could bring about mass sterilisation,\" says Ward.</p><p>Just as in Agatha Christie's <em>Murder on the Orient Express</em> &ndash; spoilers for a novel published in 1934 &ndash; it would probably take several killers, acting at roughly the same time, to destroy all life on Earth, says Ward. \"They could be large impacts, or nearby supernovae, or even something like freezing of the core. No one single event is going to do it.\" But if a big rock or GRB was to hit Earth after life had culled itself, mass sterilisation might just follow.</p><p>Alien forensic scientists might well conclude that life on Earth had a hand in its own demise.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p02m8g2d\"}}</p><p><strong>Expanding Sun</strong></p><p><strong>Timeframe: </strong>between 1 and 7.5 billion years</p><p>If none of that gets us, the Sun will. Our home star bathes us in light, and supplies the energy for almost all the life on Earth. But it won't be friendly forever.</p><p>As we saw earlier, the Sun is gradually getting hotter. Eventually it will be hot enough to evaporate all Earth's oceans, and cause a runaway greenhouse effect that sends temperatures soaring upwards. This process might begin <a href=\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/nature12827\">in about a billion years</a>, and would wipe out all but the most resistant microorganisms.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p02m8fb4\"}}</p><p>But that's not all.

So the expanding Sun will engulf, and destroy, the Earth.</p><p>It's been suggested that Earth might escape. The Sun will lose mass as it grows, so Earth will spiral further out. But according to calculations performed in 2008, <a href=\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2966.2008.13022.x\">this won't be enough to save our planet</a>.</p><p>If that's true, the only hope lies with us. If any humans are still around, <a href=\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1023/A:1002790227314\">they might have the technology to move the Earth to safety</a>.

There can hardly be a bigger question. For much of human history, almost everyone believed some version of "the gods did it". Any other explanation was inconceivable.</p><p>That is no longer true. Over the last century, a few scientists have tried to figure out how the first life might have sprung up. They have even tried to recreate this Genesis moment in their labs: to create brand-new life from scratch.</p><p>So far nobody has managed it, but we have come a long way. Today, many of the scientists studying the origin of life are confident that they are on the right track &ndash; and they have the experiments to back up their confidence.</p><p>This is the story of our quest to discover our ultimate origin. It is a story of obsession, struggle and brilliant creativity, which encompasses some of the greatest discoveries of modern science. The endeavour to understand life's beginnings has sent men and women to the furthest corners of our planet. Some of the scientists involved have been bedevilled as monsters, while others had to do their work under the heel of brutal totalitarian governments.</p><p>This is the story of the birth of life on Earth.</p><p><div class="inline-media inline-image">

But life dates back much further.</p><p>The <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1089/ast.2013.1030">oldest</a> <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/ngeo1238">known</a> <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.precamres.2007.04.013">fossils</a> are around 3.5 billion years old, 14 times the age of the oldest dinosaurs. But the fossil record may stretch back still further. For instance, in August 2016 researchers found <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/nature19355" target="_blank">what appear to be fossilised microbes</a> dating back <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-37235447">3.7 billion years</a>.</p><p><div class="inline-media inline-image">

Cells were first discovered in the 17th Century, when the first modern microscopes were invented, but it took well over a century for anyone to realise that they were the basis of all life.</p><blockquote><p> Using only the materials and conditions found on the Earth over 3.5 billion years ago, we have to make a cell </p></blockquote><p>You might not think you look much like a catfish or a <em>Tyrannosaurus rex</em>, but a microscope will reveal that you are all made of pretty similar kinds of cells. So are plants and fungi.</p><p>But by far the most numerous forms of life are microorganisms, each of which is made up of just one cell. Bacteria are the most famous group, and they are found everywhere on Earth.</p><p>In April 2016, scientists presented <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/nmicrobiol.2016.48">an updated version of the "tree of life"</a>: a kind of family tree for every living species. Almost all of the branches are bacteria. What's more, the shape of the tree suggests that a bacterium was the common ancestor of all life. In other words, every living thing &ndash; including you &ndash; is ultimately descended from a bacterium.</p><p>This means we can define the problem of the origin of life more precisely. Using only the materials and conditions found on the Earth over 3.5 billion years ago, we have to make a cell.</p><p>Well, how hard can it be?</p><p><div class="inline-media inline-image">

    </a></div></p><p><strong>Chapter 1. The first experiments</strong></p><p>For most of history, it was not really considered necessary to ask how life began, because the answer seemed obvious.</p><p>Before the 1800s, most people believed in "vitalism". This is the intuitive idea that living things were endowed with a special, magical property that made them different from inanimate objects.</p><blockquote><p> The chemicals of life can all be made from simpler chemicals that have nothing to do with life </p></blockquote><p>Vitalism was often bound up with cherished religious beliefs. The Bible says that God used "<a href="https://www.kingjamesbibleonline.org/Genesis-2-7/">the breath of life</a>" to animate the first humans, and the immortal soul is a form of vitalism.</p><p>There is just one problem. Vitalism is plain wrong.</p><p>By the early 1800s, scientists had discovered several substances that seemed to be unique to life. One such chemical was urea, which is found in urine and was isolated in 1799.</p><p>This was still, just, compatible with vitalism. Only living things seemed to be able to make these chemicals, so perhaps they were infused with life energy and that was what made them special.</p><p>But in 1828, the German chemist Friedrich W&ouml;hler found <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/andp.18280880206">a way to make urea from a common chemical called ammonium cyanate</a>, which had no obvious connection with living things. Others followed in his footsteps, and it was soon clear that the chemicals of life can all be made from simpler chemicals that have nothing to do with life.</p><p><div class="inline-media inline-image">

    </a></div></p><p>This was the end of vitalism as a scientific concept. But people found it profoundly hard to let go of the idea. For many, saying that there is nothing "special" about the chemicals of life seemed to rob life of its magic, to reduce us to mere machines. It also, of course, contradicted the Bible.</p><blockquote><p> The mystery of life's origin was ignored for decades </p></blockquote><p>Even scientists have struggled to shed vitalism. As late as 1913, the English biochemist Benjamin Moore was fervently pushing a theory of "<a href="http://www.readbookonline.net/readOnLine/20877/">biotic energy</a>", which was essentially vitalism under a different name. The idea had a strong emotional hold.</p><p>Today the idea clings on in unexpected places. For example, there are plenty of science-fiction stories in which a person's "life energy" can be boosted or drained away. Think of the "regeneration energy" used by the Time Lords in <em>Doctor Who</em>, <a href="http://tardis.wikia.com/wiki/The_Time_of_the_Doctor_%28TV_story%29">which can even be topped up if it runs low</a>. This feels futuristic, but it is a deeply old-fashioned idea.</p><p>Still, after 1828 scientists had legitimate reasons to look for a deity-free explanation for how the first life formed. But they did not. It seems like an obvious subject to explore, but in fact the mystery of life's origin was ignored for decades. Perhaps everyone was still too emotionally attached to vitalism to take the next step.</p><p><div class="inline-media inline-image">

Instead of each of the different species being created individually by God, they were all descended from a primordial organism that lived millions of years ago: the last universal common ancestor.</p><p>This idea proved immensely controversial, again because it contradicted the Bible.

    </a></div></p><p>Darwin knew that it was a profound question, but &ndash; perhaps wary of starting yet another fight with the Church &ndash; he only seems to have discussed the issue <a href="http://www.darwinproject.ac.uk/editors-blog/2012/02/15/darwins-warm-little-pond/">in a letter written in 1871</a>. His excitable language reveals that he knew the deep significance of the question:</p><blockquote><p> The first hypothesis for the origin of life was invented in a savagely totalitarian country </p></blockquote><p>"But if (&amp; oh what a big if) we could conceive in some warm little pond with all sorts of ammonia &amp; phosphoric salts,&mdash;light, heat, electricity &amp;c present, that a protein compound was chemically formed, ready to undergo still more complex changes..."</p><p>In other words, what if there was once a small body of water, filled with simple organic compounds and bathed in sunlight. Some of those compounds might combine to form a life-like substance such as a protein, which could then start evolving and becoming more complex.</p><p>It was a sketchy idea. But it would become the basis of the first hypothesis for how life began.</p><p>This idea emerged from an unexpected place. You might think that this daring piece of free thinking would have been developed in a democratic country with a tradition of free speech: perhaps the United States. But in fact the first hypothesis for the origin of life was invented in a savagely totalitarian country, where free thinking was stamped out: the USSR.</p><p><div class="inline-media inline-image">

That included people's ideas, even on subjects &ndash; like biology &ndash; that seem unrelated to Communist politics.</p><blockquote><p> Oparin imagined what Earth was like when it was newly formed </p></blockquote><p>Most famously, Stalin effectively banned scientists from studying conventional genetics. Instead he imposed <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10739-011-9287-3">the ideas</a> of a farm worker named <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00bw51j">Trofim Lysenko</a>, which he thought were more in line with Communist ideology. Scientists working on genetics were forced to publicly support Lysenko's ideas, or risk ending up in a labour camp.</p><p>It was in this repressive environment that Alexander Oparin carried out his research into biochemistry. He was able to keep working because he was a loyal Communist: he supported Lysenko's ideas and even received the Order of Lenin, the highest decoration that could be bestowed on someone living in the USSR.</p><p>In 1924, Oparin published his book <a href="http://www.valencia.edu/~orilife/textos/The%20Origin%20of%20Life.pdf"><em>The Origin of Life</em></a>.

    </a></div></p><p>Oparin imagined what Earth was like when it was newly formed. The surface was searingly hot, as rocks from space plunged down onto it and impacted. It was a mess of semi-molten rocks, containing a huge range of chemicals &ndash; including many based on carbon.</p><blockquote><p> If you watch coacervates under a microscope, they behave unnervingly like living cells </p></blockquote><p>Eventually the Earth cooled enough for water vapour to condense into liquid water, and the first rain fell. Before long Earth had oceans, which were hot and rich in carbon-based chemicals. Now two things could happen.</p><p>First, the various chemicals could react with each other to form lots of new compounds, some of which would be more complex. Oparin supposed that the molecules central to life, like sugars and amino acids, could all have formed in Earth's waters.</p><p>Second, some of the chemicals began to form microscopic structures. Many organic chemicals do not dissolve in water: for example, oil forms a layer on top of water. But when some of these chemicals contact water they form spherical globules called "coacervates", which can be up to 0.01cm (0.004 inches) across.</p><p>If you watch coacervates under a microscope, they behave unnervingly like living cells. They grow and change shape, and sometimes divide into two. They can also take in chemicals from the surrounding water, so life-like chemicals can become concentrated inside them. Oparin proposed that coacervates were the ancestors of modern cells.</p><blockquote><p> The idea that living organisms formed by purely chemical means, without a god or even a "life force", was radical </p></blockquote><p>Five years later in 1929, the English biologist J. B. S. Haldane independently proposed some very similar ideas in <a href="http://www.uv.es/~orilife/textos/Haldane.pdf">a short article</a> published in the <a href="https://newhumanist.org.uk/history"><em>Rationalist Annual</em></a>.</p><p>Haldane had already made enormous contributions to evolutionary theory, helping to integrate Darwin's ideas with the emerging science of genetics.</p><p>He was also a larger-than-life character. On one occasion, he suffered a perforated eardrum thanks to some experiments with decompression chambers, but later wrote that: "the drum generally heals up; and if a hole remains in it, although one is somewhat deaf, one can blow tobacco smoke out of the ear in question, which is a social accomplishment."</p><p>Just like Oparin, Haldane outlined how organic chemicals could build up in water, "[until] the primitive oceans reached the consistency of hot dilute soup". This set the stage for "the first living or half-living things" to form, and for each one to become enclosed in "an oily film".</p><p><div class="inline-media inline-image">

    </a></div></p><p>It is telling that of all the biologists in the world, it was Oparin and Haldane who proposed this. The idea that living organisms formed by purely chemical means, without a god or even a "life force", was radical. Like Darwin's theory of evolution before it, it flew in the face of Christianity.</p><blockquote><p> There was one problem. There was no experimental evidence to back it up </p></blockquote><p>That suited the USSR just fine. The Soviet regime was officially atheist, and its leaders were eager to support materialistic explanations for profound phenomena like life. Haldane was also an atheist, and a devoted communist to boot.</p><p>"At that time, to accept or not accept this idea depended essentially on personalities: whether they were religious or whether they supported left or communist ideas," says origin-of-life expert <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Q7YTFCQAAAAJ&amp;hl=en">Armen Mulkidjanian</a> of the University of Osnabr&uuml;ck in Germany. "In the Soviet Union they were accepted happily because they didn't need God. In the western world, if you look for people who were thinking in this direction, they all were lefties, communists and so on."</p><p>The idea that life formed in a primordial soup of organic chemicals became known as the Oparin-Haldane hypothesis. It was neat and compelling, but there was one problem. There was no experimental evidence to back it up. This would not arrive for almost a quarter of a century.</p><p><div class="inline-media inline-image">

During World War Two Urey worked on the Manhattan Project, collecting the unstable uranium-235 needed for the bomb's core. After the war he fought to keep nuclear technology in civilian control.</p><blockquote><p> In 1952, Miller began the most famous experiment on the origin of life ever attempted </p></blockquote><p>He also became interested in the chemistry of outer space, particularly what went on when the Solar System was first forming. One day he gave a lecture and pointed out that there was probably no oxygen in Earth's atmosphere when it first formed. This would have offered the ideal conditions for Oparin and Haldane's primordial soup to form: the fragile chemicals would have been destroyed by contact with oxygen.</p><p>A doctoral student named Stanley Miller was in the audience, and later approached Urey with a proposal: could they test this idea?

Miller connected a series of glass flasks and circulated four chemicals that he suspected were present on the early Earth: boiling water, hydrogen gas, ammonia and methane. He subjected the gases to repeated electric shocks, to simulate the lightning strikes that would have been a common occurrence on Earth so long ago.</p><blockquote><p> You can go from a simple atmosphere and produce lots of biological molecules </p></blockquote><p>Miller found that "the water in the flask became noticeably pink after the first day, and by the end of the week the solution was deep red and turbid". Clearly, a mix of chemicals had formed.</p><p>When Miller analysed the mixture he found that it contained two amino acids: glycine and alanine. Amino acids are often described as the building blocks of life. They are used to form the proteins that control most biochemical processes in our bodies. Miller had made two of life's most important components, from scratch.</p><p><a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1126/science.117.3046.528">The results were published in the prestigious journal <em>Science</em> in 1953</a>.

They had instead begun to explore the possibility that life formed spontaneously and naturally on the early Earth &ndash; and thanks to Stanley Miller's iconic experiment, they even had some practical support for the idea.</em></p><p>While Miller was trying to make the stuff of life from scratch, other scientists were figuring out what genes were made of.</p><p>By this time, many biological molecules were known. These included sugars, fats, proteins &ndash; and nucleic acids such as "deoxyribonucleic acid", or DNA for short.</p><blockquote><p> Theirs was one of the greatest scientific discoveries of the 20th Century </p></blockquote><p>Today we take it for granted that DNA carries our genes, but this actually came as a shock to 1950s biologists. Proteins are more complex, so scientists thought they were the genes.</p><p>That idea was disproved in 1952 by Alfred Hershey and Martha Chase of the Carnegie Institution of Washington. They studied simple viruses that only contain DNA and protein, and which have to infect bacteria in order to reproduce. They found that it was the viral DNA that entered the bacteria: <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1085/jgp.36.1.39">the proteins stayed outside</a>. Clearly, DNA was the genetic material.</p><p>Hershey and Chase's findings triggered a frantic race to figure out the structure of DNA, and thus how it worked. The following year, the problem was cracked by <a href="https://profiles.nlm.nih.gov/ps/retrieve/Narrative/SC/p-nid/141">Francis Crick</a> and <a href="http://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/medicine/laureates/1962/watson-bio.html">James Watson</a> of the University of Cambridge, UK &ndash; with a lot of under-acknowledged help from their colleague <a href="https://profiles.nlm.nih.gov/ps/retrieve/Narrative/KR/p-nid/183">Rosalind Franklin</a>.</p><p>Theirs was one of the greatest scientific discoveries of the 20th Century. It also reshaped the search for the origin of life, by revealing the incredible intricacy that is hidden inside living cells.</p><p><div class="inline-media inline-image">

The two "poles" of the ladder are each built from molecules called nucleotides.</p><blockquote><p> Your genes ultimately come from an ancestral bacterium </p></blockquote><p>This structure explained how cells copy their DNA. In other words, it revealed how parents make copies of their genes and pass them on to their children.</p><p>The key point is that the double helix can be "unzipped". This exposes the genetic code &ndash; made up of sequences of the genetic bases A, T, C and G &ndash; that is normally locked away inside the DNA ladder&rsquo;s "rungs". Each strand is then used as a template to recreate a copy of the other.</p><p>Using this mechanism, genes have been passed down from parent to child since the beginning of life. Your genes ultimately come from an ancestral bacterium &ndash; and at every step they were copied using the mechanism Crick and Watson discovered.</p><p>Explore the structure of DNA in this video:</p><p><div class="inline-media inline-video">

Over the next few years, biochemists raced to figure out exactly what information DNA carries, and how that information is used in living cells. The innermost secrets of life were being exposed for the first time.</p><blockquote><p> Suddenly, Oparin and Haldane's ideas looked naively simple </p></blockquote><p>It turned out that DNA only has one job. <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/227561a0">Your DNA tells your cells how to make proteins</a>: molecules that perform a host of essential tasks. Without proteins you could not digest your food, your heart would stop and you could not breathe.</p><p>But the process of using DNA to make proteins proved to be staggeringly intricate. That was a big problem for anyone trying to explain the origin of life, because it is hard to imagine how something so complex could ever have got started.</p><p>Each protein is essentially a long chain of amino acids, strung together in a specific order. The sequence of the amino acids determines the three-dimensional shape of the protein, and thus what it does.</p><p>That information is encoded <a href="http://users.rcn.com/jkimball.ma.ultranet/BiologyPages/C/Codons.html">in the sequence of the DNA's bases</a>. So when a cell needs to make a particular protein, it reads the relevant gene in the DNA to get the sequence of amino acids.</p><blockquote><p> It turned out that DNA only has one job </p></blockquote><p>But there is a twist. DNA is precious, so cells prefer to keep it bundled away safely. For this reason, they copy the information from DNA onto short molecules of another substance called RNA (ribonucleic acid). If DNA is a library book, RNA is a scrap of paper with a key passage scribbled onto it. RNA is similar to DNA, except that it only has one strand.</p><p>Finally, the process of converting the information in that RNA strand into a protein takes place in an enormously elaborate molecule called a "ribosome".</p><p>This process is going on in every living cell, even the simplest bacteria. It is as essential to life as eating and breathing. Any explanation for the origin of life must show how this complex trinity &ndash; DNA, RNA and ribosome protein &ndash; came into existence and started working.</p><p><div class="inline-media inline-image">

    </a></div></p><p>Suddenly, Oparin and Haldane's ideas looked naively simple, while Miller's experiment, which only produced a few of the amino acids used to build proteins, looked amateurish. Far from taking us most of the way to creating life, his seminal study was clearly just the first step on a long road.</p><blockquote><p> The idea that life began with RNA would prove enormously influential </p></blockquote><p>"DNA makes RNA makes protein, all in this lipid-encapsulated bag of chemicals," says John Sutherland. "You look at that and it's just 'wow, that's too complicated'. How are we going to find organic chemistry that will make all that in one go?"</p><p>The first person to really tackle this head-on was a British chemist named <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1098/rsbm.2013.0002">Leslie Orgel</a>. He was one of the first to see Crick and Watson's model of DNA, and would later <a href="http://www.the-scientist.com/?articles.view/articleNo/25641/title/Leslie-Orgel-dies/">help Nasa</a> with their Viking programme, which sent robotic landers to Mars.</p><p>Orgel set out to simplify the problem. <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0022-2836(68)90393-8">Writing in 1968</a>, and <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0022-2836(68)90392-6">supported by Crick</a>, he suggested that the first life did not have proteins or DNA. Instead, it was made almost entirely of RNA. For this to work, these primordial RNA molecules must have been particularly versatile. For one thing, they must have been able to build copies of themselves, presumably using the same base-pairing mechanism as DNA.</p><p>The idea that life began with RNA would prove enormously influential. But it also triggered a scientific turf war that has lasted until the present day.</p><p><div class="inline-media inline-image">

    </a></div></p><p>By suggesting that life began with RNA and little else, Orgel was proposing that one crucial aspect of life &ndash; its ability to reproduce itself &ndash; appeared before all the others. In a sense, he was not just suggesting how life was first assembled: he was saying something about what life is.</p><blockquote><p> Scientists studying the origin of life split into camps </p></blockquote><p>Many biologists would agree with Orgel's "replication first" idea. In Darwin's theory of evolution, the ability to create offspring is absolutely central: the only way an organism can "win" is to leave behind lots of children.</p><p>But there are other features of life that seem equally essential. The most obvious is metabolism: the ability to extract energy from your surroundings and use it to keep yourself alive. For many biologists, metabolism must have been the original defining feature of life, with replication emerging later.</p><p>So from the 1960s onwards, scientists studying the origin of life split into camps.</p><p>"The basic polarisation was metabolism-first versus genetics-first," says Sutherland.</p><blockquote><p> Scientific meetings on the origin of life have often been fractious affairs </p></blockquote><p>Meanwhile, a third group maintained that the first thing to appear was a container for the key molecules, to keep them from floating off. "Compartmentalisation must have come first, because there's no point doing metabolism unless you're compartmentalised," says Sutherland. In other words, there needed to be a cell &ndash; as Oparin and Haldane had emphasised a few decades earlier &ndash; <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1023/A:1006746807104">perhaps enclosed by a membrane of simple fats and lipids</a>.</p><p>All three ideas acquired adherents and have survived to the present day. Scientists have become passionately committed to their pet ideas, sometimes blindly so.</p><p>As a result, scientific meetings on the origin of life have often been fractious affairs, and journalists covering the subject are regularly told by a scientist in one camp that the ideas emerging from the other camps are stupid or worse.</p><p>Thanks to Orgel, the idea that life began with RNA and genetics got off to an early head start. Then came the 1980s, and a startling discovery that seemed to pretty much confirm it.</p><p><div class="inline-media inline-image">

    </a></div></p><p><strong>Chapter 3. Search for the first replicator</strong></p><p><em>After the 1960s, the scientists on the quest to understand life's origins split into three groups. Some were convinced that life began with the formation of primitive versions of biological cells. Others thought the key first step was a metabolic system, and yet others focused on the importance of genetics and replication. This last group began trying to figure out what that first replicator might have looked like &ndash; with a focus on the idea that it was made of RNA.</em></p><p>As early as the 1960s, scientists had reason to think RNA was the source of all life.</p><p>Specifically, RNA can do something that DNA cannot. It is a single-stranded molecule, so unlike stiff, double-stranded DNA it can fold itself into a range of different shapes.</p><blockquote><p> You could not live without enzymes </p></blockquote><p>RNA's origami-like folding looked rather similar to the way proteins behave. Proteins are also basically long strands &ndash; made of amino acids rather than nucleotides &ndash; and this allows them to construct elaborate structures.</p><p>This is the key to proteins' most amazing ability. Some of them can speed up, or "catalyse", chemical reactions. These proteins are known as enzymes.</p><p>Many enzymes are found in your guts, where they break up the complex molecules from your food into simple ones like sugars that your cells can use. You could not live without enzymes.</p><p>Leslie Orgel and Francis Crick had a suspicion. If RNA could fold like a protein, maybe it could form enzymes. If that were true, RNA could have been the original &ndash; and highly versatile &ndash; living molecule, storing information as DNA does now and catalysing reactions as some proteins do.</p><p>It was a neat idea, but there would be no proof for over a decade.</p><p><div class="inline-media inline-image">

By the time he was in junior high school he was visiting the local university and <a href="http://cech.checknobel.com/1.htm">knocking on geologists' doors</a>, asking to see models of mineral structures.</p><p>But he eventually wound up becoming a biochemist, focusing on RNA.</p><blockquote><p> Now the notion that life began with RNA was looking promising </p></blockquote><p>In the early 1980s, Cech and his colleagues at the University of Colorado Boulder were studying a single-celled organism called <em>Tetrahymena thermophila</em>. Part of its cellular machinery includes strands of RNA. Cech found that one particular section of the RNA sometimes detached from the rest, as if something had cut it out with scissors.</p><p>When the team removed all the enzymes and other molecules that might be acting as molecular scissors, the RNA kept doing it. They had discovered <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0092-8674(82)90414-7">the first RNA enzyme</a>: a short piece of RNA that was able to cut itself out of the larger strand it was part of.</p><p>Cech published the results in 1982.

In the 1990s he took on his biggest challenge: figuring out the structure of the ribosome.</p><blockquote><p> The fact that this essential machine was based on RNA made the RNA World even more plausible </p></blockquote><p>Every living cell has a ribosome. This huge molecule reads instructions from RNA and strings together amino acids to make proteins. The ribosomes in your cells built most of your body.</p><p>The ribosome was known to contain RNA. But in 2000 Steitz's team produced <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1126/science.289.5481.920">a detailed image of the ribosome's structure</a>, which showed that <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1126/science.289.5481.878">the RNA was the catalytic core of the ribosome</a>.</p><p>This was critical, because the ribosome is so fundamental to life, and so ancient.

If life began with an RNA molecule, that RNA must have been able to make copies of itself: it should have been self-replicating.</p><p>But no known RNA can self-replicate. Nor can DNA.

As a child he was so fascinated with chemistry that he had a lab in his basement. With a splendid disregard for his own safety, <a href="http://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/medicine/laureates/2009/szostak-bio.html">he once set off an explosion</a> that embedded a glass tube into the ceiling.</p><blockquote><p> They had showed that RNA enzymes could be truly powerful </p></blockquote><p>In the early 1980s, Szostak helped to show how our genes protect themselves against the ageing process. This early research would eventually <a href="http://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/medicine/laureates/2009/">net him a share of a Nobel Prize</a>.</p><p>But he soon became fascinated by Cech's RNA enzymes. "I thought that work was just really cool," he says. "In principle, there might be a possibility for RNA to catalyse its own replication."</p><p>In 1988, Cech found <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1126/science.2450400">an RNA enzyme that could build a short RNA molecule about 10 nucleotides long</a>. Szostak set out to improve on the discovery by evolving new RNA enzymes in the lab. His team created a pool of random sequences and tested them to see which ones showed catalytic activity.

R18 consisted of a string of 189 nucleotides, and <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1126/science.1060786">it could reliably add 11 nucleotides to a strand</a>: 6% of its own length. The hope was that a few tweaks would allow it to make a strand 189 nucleotides long &ndash; as long as itself.</p><blockquote><p> RNA does not seem to be up to the job of kick-starting life </p></blockquote><p>The best attempt came in 2011 from <a href="http://www2.mrc-lmb.cam.ac.uk/groups/ph1/">Philipp Holliger</a> of the Laboratory of Molecular Biology in Cambridge, UK. <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1126/science.1200752">His team created a modified R18 called tC19Z</a>, which copies sequences up to 95 nucleotides long. That is 48% of its own length: more than R18, but not the necessary 100%.</p><p>An alternative approach has been put forward by <a href="http://www.scripps.edu/joyce/">Gerald Joyce</a> and Tracey Lincoln of the Scripps Research Institute in La Jolla, California. In 2009 they created <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1126/science.1167856">an RNA enzyme that replicates itself indirectly</a>.</p><p>Their enzyme joins together two short pieces of RNA to create a second enzyme. This then joins together another two RNA pieces to recreate the original enzyme.</p><p>This simple cycle could be continued indefinitely, given the raw materials. But the enzymes only worked if they were given the correct RNA strands, which Joyce and Lincoln had to make.</p><p><div class="inline-media inline-image">

RNA does not seem to be up to the job of kick-starting life.</p><blockquote><p> Maybe there was some other type of molecule on the early Earth </p></blockquote><p>The case has also been weakened by chemists' failure to make RNA from scratch. It looks like a simple molecule compared to DNA, but RNA has proved to be enormously difficult to make.</p><p>The problem is the sugar and the base that make up each nucleotide.

It left many biologists with a nagging suspicion that the RNA World hypothesis, while neat, could not be quite right.</p><p>Instead, maybe there was some other type of molecule on the early Earth: something simpler than RNA, which really could assemble itself out of the primordial soup and start self-replicating. This might have come first, and then led to RNA, DNA and the rest.</p><p><div class="inline-media inline-image">

Nielsen kept the bases the same &ndash; sticking with the A, T, C and G found in DNA &ndash; but made the backbone out of molecules called polyamides instead of the sugars found in DNA. He called the new molecule <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1126/science.1962210">polyamide nucleic acid</a>, or PNA. Confusingly, it has since become known as peptide nucleic acid.</p><blockquote><p> PNA, unlike RNA, might have formed readily on the early Earth </p></blockquote><p>PNA has never been found in nature. But it behaves a lot like DNA. A strand of PNA can even take the place of one of the strands in a DNA molecule, with the complementary bases pairing up as normal. What's more, <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/368561a0">PNA can coil up into a double helix</a>, just like DNA.</p><p>Stanley Miller was intrigued. Deeply sceptical about the RNA World, he suspected that <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/nsb0397-167">PNA was a more plausible candidate for the first genetic material</a>.</p><p>In 2000 he produced some hard evidence. By then he was 70 years old, and had just suffered <a href="http://ucsdnews.ucsd.edu/archive/newsrel/science/05-07OriginofLifeKM-.asp">the first in a series of debilitating strokes</a> that would ultimately leave him confined to a nursing home, but he was not quite done. He repeated his classic experiment, which we discussed in Chapter One, this time using methane, nitrogen, ammonia and water &ndash; and obtained the polyamide backbone of PNA.</p><p>This suggested that PNA, unlike RNA, might have formed readily on the early Earth.</p><p><div class="inline-media inline-image">

One group was convinced that life began with a molecule of RNA, but they struggled to work out how RNA or similar molecules could have formed spontaneously on the early Earth and then made copies of themselves. Their efforts were exciting at first, but ultimately frustrating. However, even while this research was progressing, there were other origin-of-life researchers who felt sure that life began in a completely different way.</em></p><p>The RNA World theory relies on a simple idea: the most important thing a living organism can do is reproduce itself. Many biologists would agree with this. From bacteria to blue whales, all living things strive to have offspring.</p><blockquote><p> W&auml;chtersh&auml;user proposed that the first organisms were "drastically different from anything we know" </p></blockquote><p>However, many origin-of-life researchers do not believe reproduction is truly fundamental. Before an organism can reproduce, they say, it has to be self-sustaining. It must keep itself alive. After all, you cannot have kids if you die first.</p><p>We keep ourselves alive by eating food, while green plants do it by extracting energy from sunlight. You might not think that a person wolfing down a juicy steak looks much like a leafy oak tree, but when you get right down to it, both are taking in energy.</p><p>This process is called metabolism. First, you must obtain energy; say, from energy-rich chemicals like sugars. Then you must use that energy to build useful things like cells.</p><p>This process of harnessing energy is so utterly essential, many researchers believe it must have been the first thing life ever did.</p><p><div class="inline-media inline-image">

One of the most influential suggestions <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0723-2020(88)80001-8">was put forward in the late 1980s</a> by G&uuml;nter W&auml;chtersh&auml;user. He was not a full-time scientist, but rather a patent lawyer with a background in chemistry.</p><p>W&auml;chtersh&auml;user proposed that the first organisms were "<a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC373159/">drastically different from anything we know</a>". They were not made of cells. They did not have enzymes, DNA or RNA.</p><blockquote><p> All the other things that make up modern organisms &ndash; like DNA, cells and brains &ndash; came later </p></blockquote><p>Instead, W&auml;chtersh&auml;user imagined a flow of hot water streaming out of a volcano. The water was rich in volcanic gases like ammonia, and held traces of minerals from the volcano's heart.</p><p>Where the water flowed over the rocks, chemical reactions began to take place. In particular, metals from the water helped simple organic compounds to fuse into larger ones.</p><p>The turning point was the creation of the first metabolic cycle. This is a process in which one chemical is converted into a series of other chemicals, until eventually the original chemical is recreated. In the process, the entire system takes in energy, which can be used to restart the cycle &ndash; and to start doing other things.</p><blockquote><p> Metabolic cycles may not seem life-like, but they are fundamental to life </p></blockquote><p>All the other things that make up modern organisms &ndash; like DNA, cells and brains &ndash; came later, built on the back of these chemical cycles.</p><p>These metabolic cycles do not sound much like life. W&auml;chtersh&auml;user called his inventions "precursor organisms" and wrote that they "can barely be called living".</p><p>But metabolic cycles like the ones W&auml;chtersh&auml;user described are at the core of every living thing. Your cells are essentially microscopic chemical processing plants, constantly turning one chemical into another. Metabolic cycles may not seem life-like, but they are fundamental to life.</p><p>Over the 1980s and 1990s, W&auml;chtersh&auml;user worked out his theory in considerable detail. He outlined which minerals made for the best surfaces and <a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.87.1.200">which chemical cycles might take place</a>. His ideas began to attract supporters.</p><p>But it was all still theoretical. W&auml;chtersh&auml;user needed a real-world discovery that backed up his ideas. Fortunately, it had already been made &ndash; a decade earlier.</p><p><div class="inline-media inline-image">

They were surveying the Gal&aacute;pagos hotspot, where tall ridges of rock rise from the sea floor. The ridges, they knew, were volcanically active.</p><blockquote><p> Each vent was a kind of primordial soup dispenser </p></blockquote><p>Corliss found that the ridges were pockmarked with, essentially, hot springs. Hot, chemical-rich water was welling up from below the sea floor and <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1126/science.203.4385.1073">pumping out through holes in the rocks</a>.</p><p>Astonishingly, these "hydrothermal vents" were densely populated by strange animals. There were huge clams, limpets, mussels, and tubeworms. The water was also thick with bacteria. All these organisms lived on the energy from the hydrothermal vents.</p><p>The discovery of hydrothermal vents made Corliss's name. It also got him thinking. In 1981 he proposed that similar vents existed on Earth four billion years ago, and that <a href="http://archimer.ifremer.fr/doc/00245/35661/">they were the site of the origin of life</a>.

Each vent, he said, was a kind of primordial soup dispenser.</p><blockquote><p> Key compounds like sugars "would survive&hellip; for seconds at most" </p></blockquote><p>As hot water flowed up through the rocks, the heat and pressure caused simple organic compounds to fuse into more complex ones like amino acids, nucleotides and sugars. Closer to the boundary with the ocean, where the water was not quite as hot, they began linking into chains &ndash; forming carbohydrates, proteins, and nucleotides like DNA. Then, as the water approached the ocean and cooled still further, these molecules assembled into simple cells.</p><p>It was neat, and <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF01808177">caught people's attention</a>. But Stanley Miller, whose seminal origin-of-life experiment we discussed in Chapter One, was not convinced. <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/334609a0">Writing in 1988</a>, he argued the vents were too hot.</p><p>While extreme heat would trigger the formation of chemicals like amino acids, Miller's experiments suggested that it would also destroy them. Key compounds like sugars "would survive&hellip; for seconds at most". What's more, these simple molecules would be unlikely to link up into chains, because the surrounding water would break the chains almost immediately.</p><p><div class="inline-media inline-image">

    </a></div></p><p>At this point the geologist <a href="https://science.jpl.nasa.gov/people/Russell/">Mike Russell</a> stepped into the fray. He thought that the vent theory <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/336117a0">could be made to work after all</a>. What's more, it seemed to him that the vents were the ideal home for W&auml;chtersh&auml;user's precursor organisms. This inspiration would lead him to create one of the most widely-accepted theories of the origin of life.</p><blockquote><p> If Russell was correct, life began at the bottom of the sea </p></blockquote><p>Russell had spent his early life variously making aspirin, scouting for valuable minerals and &ndash; <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/459316a">in one remarkable incident in the 1960s</a> &ndash; coordinating the response to a possible volcanic eruption, despite having no training. But his real interest was in how Earth's surface has changed over the eons.

A mineral called pyrite, which is made of iron and sulphur, had formed into tubes about 1mm across.</p><p>In his lab, Russell found that <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-3121.1989.tb00364.x">the pyrite could also form spherical blobs</a>.

    </a></div></p><p>In the 1960s, the biochemist <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1098/rsbm.1994.0040">Peter Mitchell</a> fell ill and was forced to resign from the University of Edinburgh. Instead, he set up a private lab in a remote manor house in Cornwall. Isolated from the scientific community, <a href="https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg20427306-200-was-our-oldest-ancestor-a-proton-powered-rock/">his work was partly funded by a herd of dairy cows</a>. Many biochemists, <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/46903">including, initially, Leslie Orgel</a>, whose work on RNA we discussed in Chapter Two, thought that his ideas were utterly ridiculous.</p><blockquote><p> We now know that the process Mitchell identified is used by every living thing on Earth </p></blockquote><p>Less than two decades later, Mitchell achieved the ultimate victory: <a href="http://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/chemistry/laureates/1978/">the 1978 Nobel Prize in Chemistry</a>. He has never been a household name, but his ideas are in every biology textbook.</p><p>Mitchell spent his career figuring out what organisms do with the energy they get from food. In effect, he was asking how we all stay alive from moment to moment.</p><p>He knew that all cells store their energy in the same molecule: adenosine triphosphate (ATP). The crucial bit is a chain of three phosphates, anchored to the adenosine. Adding the third phosphate takes a lot of energy, which is then locked up in the ATP.</p><p>When a cell needs energy &ndash; say, if a muscle needs to contract &ndash; it breaks the third phosphate off an ATP. This turns it into adenosine diphosphate (ADP) and releases the stored energy.</p><blockquote><p> He has never been a household name </p></blockquote><p>Mitchell wanted to know how the cells made the ATP in the first place.

All cells need a proton gradient to store energy.</p><p>Modern cells create the gradients by pumping protons across a membrane, but this involves complex molecular machinery that cannot have just popped into existence. So Russell made one more logical leap: life must have formed somewhere with a natural proton gradient.</p><p>Somewhere like a hydrothermal vent. But it would have to be a specific type of vent. When Earth was young the seas were acidic, and acidic water has a lot of protons floating around inside it. To create a proton gradient, the water from the vent must have been low in protons: <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF01582037">it must have been alkaline</a>.</p><p>Corliss's vents would not do.

They are not like the ones Corliss found. The water flowing from them is only 40-75C, and mildly alkaline.

In 2003 the pair set out <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1098/rstb.2002.1183">an improved version of Russell's earlier ideas</a>. It is arguably the most fleshed-out story of how life began.</p><blockquote><p> This story is now regarded as one of the leading hypotheses for the origin of life </p></blockquote><p>Thanks to Kelley, they now knew that the rocks of alkaline vents were porous: they were pocked with tiny holes filled with water. These little pockets, they suggested, acted as "cells". Each pocket contained essential chemicals, including minerals like pyrite. Combined with the natural proton gradient from the vent, they were the ideal place for metabolism to begin.</p><p>Once life had harnessed the chemical energy of the vent water, Russell and Martin say, it started making molecules like RNA. Eventually it created its own membrane and became a true cell, and escaped from the porous rock into the open water.</p><p>This story is now regarded as one of the leading hypotheses for the origin of life.</p><p><div class="inline-media inline-image">

This is the organism that lived billions of years ago and from which all existing life is descended.</p><blockquote><p> RNA World supporters say the vent theory has two problems </p></blockquote><p>We will probably never find direct fossil evidence of LUCA, but we can still make an educated guess as to how it might have looked and behaved by looking at microorganisms that do survive today. This is what Martin did.</p><p>He examined the DNA of 1,930 modern microorganisms, and identified 355 genes that almost all of them had. This is arguably evidence that these 355 genes have been passed down, from generation to generation, ever since those 1,930 microbes shared a common ancestor &ndash; roughly at the time that LUCA was alive.</p><p>The 355 genes included some for harnessing a proton gradient, but not genes for generating one &ndash; exactly as Russell and Martin's theories would predict. What's more, LUCA seems to have been adapted to the presence of chemicals like methane, which suggests it inhabited a volcanically-active environment &ndash; like a vent.</p><p>Despite this, RNA World supporters say the vent theory has two problems.

They have a step-by-step story, but none of the steps have been seen in a lab.</p><p>"The people who think replication was first, they continuously provide new experimental data," says origin-of-life expert Armen Mulkidjanian. "The people who favour metabolism-first do not."</p><blockquote><p> The chemistry of all these molecules is incompatible with water </p></blockquote><p>That could change, thanks to Martin's colleague <a href="http://www.nick-lane.net/">Nick Lane</a> of University College London. He has built an "<a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00239-014-9658-4">origin of life reactor</a>", which will simulate the conditions inside an alkaline vent. He hopes to observe metabolic cycles, and perhaps even molecules like RNA. But it is early days.</p><p>The second problem is the vents' location in the deep sea. As Miller pointed out in 1988, long-chain molecules like RNA and proteins cannot form in water without enzymes to help them.</p><p>For many researchers, this is a knock-down argument. "If you have a background in chemistry, you cannot buy the idea of deep-sea vents, because you know the chemistry of all these molecules is incompatible with water," says Mulkidjanian.</p><p>Regardless, Russell and his allies remain bullish.</p><p>But in the last decade, a third approach has come to the fore, bolstered by a series of extraordinary experiments. This promises something that neither the RNA World nor the hydrothermal vents have so far managed: a way to make an entire cell from scratch.</p><p><div class="inline-media inline-image">

Supporters of the "RNA World" were convinced that life began with a self-replicating molecule. Meanwhile, scientists in the "metabolism-first" camp had developed a detailed narrative about how life could have begun in hydrothermal vents in the deep sea. However, a third idea was about to come to the fore.</em></p><p>Every living thing on Earth is made of cells. Each cell is basically a squishy ball, with a tough outer wall or "membrane".</p><p>The point of a cell is <a href="http://wsimag.com/science-and-technology/20118-why-is-life-cellular">to keep all the essentials of life together</a>. If the outer wall gets torn open, the guts spill out and the cell dies &ndash; just as a person who has been disembowelled generally does not have long to live.</p><blockquote><p> In the heat and tempest of the early Earth, a few raw materials must have assembled into crude cells </p></blockquote><p>The outer wall of the cell is so essential, some origin-of-life researchers argue that it must have been the first thing that emerged. They think that the "genetics first" efforts discussed in Chapter Three and the "metabolism first" ideas discussed in Chapter Four are misguided. Their alternative &ndash; "compartmentalisation-first" &ndash; has its champion in <a href="http://www.plluisi.org/">Pier Luigi Luisi</a> of Roma Tre University in Rome, Italy.</p><p>Luisi's reasoning is simple and hard to argue with. How could you possibly set up a working metabolism or a self-replicating RNA, each of which relies on having a lot of chemicals in one place, unless you first have a container to keep all the molecules in?</p><p>If you accept this, there is only one way life could have begun. Somehow, in the heat and tempest of the early Earth, a few raw materials must have assembled into crude cells, or "protocells". The challenge is to make this happen in a lab: to create a simple living cell.</p><p><div class="inline-media inline-image">

Oparin highlighted the fact that certain chemicals form into blobs called coacervates, which can hold other substances in their cores. He suggested that these coacervates were the first protocells.</p><blockquote><p> The challenge was to make the protocells out of just the right stuff </p></blockquote><p>Any fatty or oily substance will form blobs or films in water. These chemicals are collectively known as lipids, and the idea that they formed the first life has been called the "<a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1023/A:1006746807104">Lipid World</a>".</p><p>But just forming blobs is not enough. The blobs need to be stable, they need to be able to divide to form "daughter" blobs, and they need at least some control over what travels in and out of them &ndash; all without the elaborate proteins that modern cells use to achieve these things.</p><p>The challenge was to make the protocells out of just the right stuff. Despite trying many substances over the decades, Luisi has never made anything lifelike enough to be convincing.</p><p><div class="inline-media inline-image">

What's more, this RNA must have been able to replicate inside the protocell.</p><blockquote><p> We would meet at origins meetings and get into these long arguments </p></blockquote><p>It was a big ask, and it meant abandoning the pure compartmentalisation-first approach. But Luisi had good reasons.</p><p>A cell with an outer wall, but no genes inside it, could not do anything much. It might be able to divide into daughter cells, but it could not pass on any information about itself to its offspring. It could only start evolving and becoming more complex if it contained some genes.</p><p>This idea would soon gain a crucial supporter in Jack Szostak, whose work on the RNA World hypothesis we explored in Chapter Three. While Luisi was a member of the compartmentalisation-first camp, Szostak supported genetics-first, so for many years they had not seen eye-to-eye.</p><p><div class="inline-media inline-image">

Writing in <em>Nature</em>, they argued that it should be possible to make simple living cells from scratch, by hosting replicating RNAs in a simple, fatty blob.</p><p>It was a dramatic idea, and Szostak soon decided to put his money where his mouth was.

Since the early Earth had lots of volcanoes, it seems likely that montmorillonite was abundant.</p><p>Back in 1986, chemist <a href="https://www.rpi.edu/dept/chem/chem_faculty/profiles/ferris.html">James Ferris</a> had shown that <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF02422142">montmorillonite is a catalyst that helps organic molecules form</a>. He later found that <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1098/rstb.2006.1903">it also accelerates the formation of small RNAs</a>.</p><p>This had led Ferris to speculate that this ordinary-looking clay was the site of the origin of life.

It was as if the protocell had a full stomach and might go pop.</p><p>To compensate, the protocell picked up more fatty acids and incorporated them into its wall, allowing it to swell to a larger size and releasing the tension.</p><p>Crucially, it took the fatty acids from other protocells that contained less RNA, causing them to shrink. This meant the protocells were competing, and <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1126/science.1100757">the ones with more RNA were winning</a>.</p><p>This suggested something even more impressive.

They made slightly more complex protocells, with several concentric outer walls a bit like the layers of an onion.

Take a single strand of RNA and a pool of loose nucleotides. Then, use those nucleotides to assemble a second strand of RNA that is complementary to the first one.</p><p>For example, a strand of RNA that reads "CGC" will produce a complementary strand that reads "GCG". If you do this twice, you will get a copy of the original "CGC", just in a roundabout way.</p><p>Orgel found that, under certain circumstances, RNA strands could copy in this way without any help from enzymes. This could have been how the first life made copies of its genes.</p><p>By 1987, Orgel could take an RNA strand 14 nucleotides long and <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0022-2836(87)90117-3">create complementary strands that were also 14 nucleotides long</a>. He did not manage anything longer, but <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/1759-2208-3-2">that was enough to intrigue Szostak</a>. His student Katarzyna Adamala tried to get this reaction going in the protocells.</p><blockquote><p> They have built protocells that hold onto their genes while taking in useful molecules from outside </p></blockquote><p>They found that the reaction needed magnesium to work, which was a problem because the magnesium destroyed the protocells. But there was a simple solution: citrate, which is almost identical to the citric acid in lemons and oranges, and which is found in all living cells anyway.</p><p><a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1126/science.1241888">In a study published in 2013</a>, they added citrate and found that it latched onto the magnesium, protecting the protocells while allowing the template copying to continue.</p><p>In other words, they had achieved what Luisi had proposed in 1994. "We started to do RNA replication chemistry inside these fatty acid vesicles," says Szostak.</p><p><div class="inline-media inline-image">

The protocells can grow and divide, and even compete with each other. RNA can replicate inside them. By any measure, they are startlingly life-like.</p><blockquote><p> Szostak's approach went against 40 years of work on the origin of life </p></blockquote><p>They are also resilient. In 2008, Szostak's team found that <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.0805086105">the protocells could survive being heated to 100C</a>, a temperature that would obliterate most modern cells. This boosted the case that the protocells were similar to the first life, which must have endured scalding heat from constant meteor impacts.</p><p>"Szostak is doing great work," says Armen Mulkidjanian.</p><p>Yet on the face of it, Szostak's approach went against 40 years of work on the origin of life. Instead of focusing on "replication-first" or "compartmentalisation-first", he found ways to get both to happen pretty much simultaneously.</p><p>That would inspire a new unified approach to the origin of life, which attempts to jumpstart all the functions of life at once.

Each group favoured their own narrative and, for the most part, rubbished competing hypotheses. This approach has certainly been successful, as evidenced by the previous chapters, but every promising idea for the origin of life has ultimately come up against a major problem. So a few researchers are now trying a more unified approach.</em></p><p>This idea got its first big boost a few years ago from a result that, on the face of it, seemed to support the traditional, replication-first RNA World.</p><blockquote><p> All the key components of life could be formed at once </p></blockquote><p>By 2009, supporters of the RNA World had a big problem. They could not make nucleotides, the building blocks of RNA, in a way that could plausibly have happened on the early Earth. This, as we learned in Chapter Three, led people to suspect that the first life was not based on RNA at all.</p><p>John Sutherland had been thinking about this problem since the 1980s. "I thought, if you could demonstrate that RNA could self-assemble that would be a cool thing to do," he says.</p><p>Fortunately for Sutherland, he had secured a job at the Laboratory of Molecular Biology (LMB) in Cambridge, UK. Most research institutions force their staff to constantly churn out new findings, but the LMB does not. So Sutherland could think about why it was so hard to make an RNA nucleotide, and to spend years developing an alternative approach.</p><p>His solution would lead him to propose a radical new idea about the origin of life, namely that all the key components of life could be formed at once.</p><p><div class="inline-media inline-image">

    </a></div></p><p>"There were certain key aspects of RNA chemistry that didn't work," says Sutherland. Each RNA nucleotide is made of a sugar, a base and a phosphate. But it had proved impossible to persuade the sugar and base to join up. The molecules were simply the wrong shape.</p><blockquote><p> He believes RNA was heavily involved, but it was not the be-all-and-end-all </p></blockquote><p>So Sutherland started trying totally different substances. Eventually his team homed in on five simple molecules, including a different sugar and cyanamide, which as the name suggests is related to cyanide. The team put these chemicals through <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/nature08013">a series of reactions</a> that ultimately produced two of the four RNA nucleotides, without ever making standalone sugars or bases.</p><p>It was a slam-dunk success, and it made Sutherland's name.</p><p>Many observers interpreted the findings as <a href="https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg21128251-300-first-life-the-search-for-the-first-replicator">further evidence for the RNA World</a>. But Sutherland himself does not see it like that at all.</p><p>The "classic" RNA World hypothesis says that, in the first organisms, RNA was responsible for all the functions of life. But Sutherland says that is "hopelessly optimistic". He believes RNA was heavily involved, but it was not the be-all-and-end-all.</p><blockquote><p> The molecules were simply the wrong shape </p></blockquote><p>Instead, he takes inspiration from the recent work of Jack Szostak, which &ndash; as discussed in Chapter Five &ndash; combines the "replication-first" RNA World with Pier Luigi Luisi's "compartmentalisation-first" ideas.</p><p>But Sutherland goes further. His approach is "everything-first". He aims to make an entire cell assemble itself, from scratch.</p><p>His first clue was an odd detail about his nucleotide synthesis, which at first seemed incidental.</p><p><div class="inline-media inline-image">

    </a></div></p><p>The last step in Sutherland's process was to bolt a phosphate onto the nucleotide. But he found that it was best to include the phosphate in the mix right from the start, because it accelerated the earlier reactions.</p><p>On the face of it, including the phosphate before it was strictly needed was a messy thing to do, but Sutherland found that this messiness was a good thing.</p><blockquote><p> Get the mixture just complicated enough and all the components of life might form at once </p></blockquote><p>This led him to think about how messy his mixtures should be. On the early Earth, there must have been dozens or hundreds of chemicals all floating around together. That sounds like a recipe for a sludge, but maybe there was an optimum level of mess.</p><p>The mixtures Stanley Miller made back in the 1950s, which we looked at in Chapter One, were far messier than Sutherland's. They did contain biological molecules, but Sutherland says they "were in trace amounts and they were accompanied by a vast number of other compounds, which are not biological".</p><p>For Sutherland, this meant that Miller's setup was not good enough. It was too messy, so the good chemicals got lost in the mixture.</p><p>So Sutherland has set out to find a "Goldilocks chemistry": one that is not so messy that it becomes useless, but also not so simple that it is limited in what it can do. Get the mixture just complicated enough and all the components of life might form at once, then come together.</p><p>In other words, four billion years ago there was a pond on the Earth. It sat there for years until the mix of chemicals was just right. Then, perhaps within minutes, the first cell came into existence.</p><p><div class="inline-media inline-image">

    </a></div></p><p>This may sound implausible, like the claims of medieval alchemists. But Sutherland's evidence is mounting. Since 2009, he has shown that the same chemistry that made his two RNA nucleotides can also make many of the other molecules of life.</p><blockquote><p> Our entire approach to the origin of life for the last 40 years has been wrong </p></blockquote><p>The obvious next step was to make more RNA nucleotides. He has not yet managed this, but in 2010 <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/ja108197s">he made closely-related molecules</a> that could potentially transform into the nucleotides.</p><p>Similarly, in 2013 he made the precursors of amino acids. This time <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/anie.201300321">he needed to add copper cyanide</a> to make the reactions go.</p><p>Cyanide-related chemicals were proving to be a common theme, and in 2015 Sutherland took them even further. He showed that the same pot of chemicals could also produce <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/nchem.2202">the precursors of lipids</a>, the molecules that make up cell walls. The reactions were all driven by ultraviolet light, involved sulphur, and relied on copper to speed them up.</p><p><div class="inline-media inline-image">

Ever since the sheer complexity of the cell became clear, scientists have been working on the assumption that the first cells must have been constructed gradually, one piece at a time.</p><p>Following Leslie Orgel's proposal that RNA came first, researchers have been "trying to get one thing before another thing, and then have that invent the other", says Sutherland. But he thinks the best way is to make everything at once.</p><p>"What we've done is to challenge the idea that it's too complicated to make everything in one go," says Sutherland. "You certainly could make the building blocks for all the systems at once."</p><p>Szostak now suspects that most attempts to make the molecules of life, and to assemble them into living cells, have failed for the same reason: the experiments were too clean.</p><blockquote><p> I've really come back to the idea that the first polymer was something pretty close to RNA </p></blockquote><p>The scientists used the handful of chemicals they were interested in, and left out all the other ones that were probably present on the early Earth. But Sutherland's work shows that, <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1098/rstb.2011.0140">by adding a few more chemicals to the mix</a>, more complex phenomena can be created.</p><p>Szostak experienced this for himself in 2005, when he was trying to get his protocells to host an RNA enzyme. The enzyme needed magnesium, which destroyed the protocells' membranes.</p><p>The solution was a surprising one. Instead of making the vesicles out of one pure fatty acid, <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/ja051784p">they made them from a mixture of two</a>. These new, impure vesicles could cope with the magnesium &ndash; and that meant they could play host to working RNA enzymes.</p><p>What's more, Szostak says the first genes might also have embraced messiness.</p><p><div class="inline-media inline-image">

There would have been a mixture of RNA nucleotides and DNA nucleotides.</p><p>In 2012 Szostak showed that <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1107113108">such a mixture could assemble into "mosaic" molecules</a> that looked and behaved pretty much like pure RNA. These jumbled RNA/DNA chains could even fold up neatly.</p><blockquote><p> There is one problem that neither Sutherland nor Szostak have found a solution for </p></blockquote><p>This suggested that it did not matter if the first organisms could not make pure RNA, or pure DNA. "I've really come back to the idea that the first polymer was something pretty close to RNA, a messier version of RNA," says Szostak.</p><p>There might even be room for the alternatives to RNA that have been cooked up in labs, like the TNA and PNA we met in Chapter Three. We do not know if any of them ever existed on Earth, but if they did the first organisms may well have used them alongside RNA.</p><p>This was not an RNA World: it was a "<a href="https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn21335-before-dna-before-rna-life-in-the-hodge-podge-world/">Hodge-Podge World</a>".</p><p>The lesson from these studies is that making the first cell might not have been as hard as it once seemed. Yes, cells are intricate machines. But it turns out that they still work, albeit not quite as well, when they are flung together slapdash from whatever is to hand.</p><p>Such clumsy cells might seem unlikely to survive on the early Earth. But they would not have had much competition, and there were no threatening predators, so in many respects life may have been easier then than it is now.</p><p><div class="inline-media inline-image">

    </a></div></p><p>There is one problem that neither Sutherland nor Szostak have found a solution for, and it is a big one. The first organism must have had some form of metabolism. Right from the start, life had to <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1098/rsob.130156">obtain energy</a> or it would have died.</p><blockquote><p> Life may have been easier then than it is now </p></blockquote><p>On that point, if on nothing else, Sutherland agrees with Mike Russell, Bill Martin and the other supporters of Chapter Four's metabolism-first theories. "While the RNA guys were fighting with the metabolism guys, both sides had a point," says Sutherland.</p><p>"The origins of metabolism have to be in there somehow," says Szostak. "The source of chemical energy is going to be the big question."</p><p>Even if Martin and Russell are wrong about life beginning in deep-sea vents, many elements of their theory are almost certainly correct. One is the importance of metals for the birth of life.</p><p><div class="inline-media inline-image">

    </a></div></p><p>In nature, many enzymes have a metal atom at their core. This is often the "active" part of the enzyme, with the rest of the molecule essentially a support structure. The first life cannot have had these complex enzymes, so instead it probably used "naked" metals as catalysts.</p><blockquote><p> Life cannot have begun in the deep sea </p></blockquote><p>G&uuml;nter W&auml;chtersh&auml;user made this point when he suggested that life formed on iron pyrite. Similarly, Russell emphasises that the waters of hydrothermal vents are rich in metals, which could act as catalysts &ndash; and Martin's study of LUCA found a lot of iron-based enzymes.</p><p>In light of this, it is telling that many of Sutherland's chemical reactions rely on copper (and, incidentally, on the sulphur that W&auml;chtersh&auml;user also emphasised), and that the RNA in Szostak's protocells needs magnesium.</p><p>It may yet be that hydrothermal vents will turn out to be crucial. "If you look at modern metabolism, there's all these really suggestive things like iron-sulphur clusters," says Szostak. That fits the idea that life began in or around a vent, where the water is rich in iron and sulphur.</p><p>That said, if Sutherland and Szostak are on the right track, one aspect of the vent theory is definitely wrong: life cannot have begun in the deep sea.</p><p><div class="inline-media inline-image">

It turns out that all cells, regardless of what organism they belong to, contain a lot of phosphate, potassium and other metals &ndash; but hardly any sodium.</p><blockquote><p> My favourite scenario at the moment would be some kind of shallow lakes or ponds on the surface </p></blockquote><p>Nowadays, cells achieve this by pumping things in and out, but the first cells cannot have done so because they would not have had the necessary machinery. So Mulkidjanian suggested that the first cells formed somewhere that had roughly the same mix of chemicals as modern cells.</p><p>That immediately eliminates the ocean. Cells contain far higher levels of potassium and phosphate than the ocean ever has, and far less sodium.</p><p>Instead, <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1117774109">it points to the geothermal ponds found near active volcanoes</a>. These ponds have exactly the cocktail of metals found in cells.</p><p><div class="inline-media inline-image">

"You have hydrothermal vents but not like the deep-sea vents, more like the kind of vents we have in volcanic areas like Yellowstone."</p><blockquote><p> Earth was pounded by meteorites throughout its first half-billion years of existence </p></blockquote><p>Sutherland's chemistry might well work in such a place. The springs have the right chemicals, the water level fluctuates so some places will dry out at times, and there is plenty of ultraviolet radiation from the Sun.</p><p>What's more, Szostak says the ponds would be suitable for his protocells.</p><p>"The protocells could be relatively cool most of the time, which is good for RNA copying and other kinds of simple metabolism," says Szostak. "But every now and then they get heated up briefly, and that helps the strands of RNA come apart ready for the next round of replication." There would also be currents, driven by the streams of hot water, which could help the protocells divide.</p><p>Drawing on many of the same lines of argument, Sutherland has put forward a third option: a meteorite impact zone.</p><p><div class="inline-media inline-image">

    </a></div></p><p>Earth was pounded by meteorites throughout its first half-billion years of existence &ndash; <a href="http://www.bbc.com/earth/story/20160415-what-really-happened-when-the-dino-killer-asteroid-struck">and has been occasionally struck ever since</a>. A decent-sized impact would create a setup rather similar to Mulkidjanian's ponds.</p><p>First, meteorites are mostly made of metal. The impact zones tend to be rich in useful metals like iron, as well as sulphur. And crucially, meteorite impacts melt the Earth's crust, leading to geothermal activity and hot water.</p><blockquote><p> If it turns out that one of the scenarios is missing a key chemical, or contains something that destroys protocells, it will be ruled out </p></blockquote><p>Sutherland imagines small rivers and streams trickling down the slopes of an impact crater, leaching cyanide-based chemicals from the rocks while ultraviolet radiation pours down from above. Each stream would have a slightly different mix of chemicals, so different reactions would happen and a whole host of organic chemicals would be produced.</p><p>Finally the streams would flow into a volcanic pond at the bottom of the crater. It could have been in a pond like this that all the pieces came together and the first protocells formed.</p><p>"That's a very specific scenario," says Sutherland. But he chose it on the basis of the chemical reactions he has found. "It's the only one we can think of that's compatible with the chemistry."</p><p>Szostak is not sure either way, but he agrees that Sutherland's idea deserves careful attention. "I think the impact scenario is nice. I think the idea of volcanic systems might also work. There's some arguments in favour of each."</p><p>For now that debate looks set to rumble on. But it will not be decided on a whim. The decision will be driven by the chemistry and the protocells. If it turns out that one of the scenarios is missing a key chemical, or contains something that destroys protocells, it will be ruled out.</p><p><div class="inline-media inline-image">

    </a></div></p><p>This means that, for the first time in history, we have the beginnings of a comprehensive explanation for how life began.</p><p>"Things are looking a lot more achievable," says Sutherland.</p><blockquote><p> The best we can ever do is to draw up a story that is consistent with all the evidence </p></blockquote><p>So far, the "everything-at-once" approach of Szostak and Sutherland offers only a sketchy narrative. But those steps that have been worked out are supported by decades of experiments.</p><p>The idea also draws on every approach to the origin of life. It attempts to harness all their good points, while at the same time solving all their problems. For instance, it does not so much try to disprove Russell's ideas about hydrothermal vents, but rather to incorporate their best elements.</p><p>We cannot know for sure what happened four billion years ago. "Even if you made a reactor and out pops <em>E. coli</em> on the other side&hellip; you still can't prove that we arose that way," says Martin.</p><p>The best we can ever do is to draw up a story that is consistent with all the evidence: with experiments in chemistry, with what we know about the early Earth, and with what biology reveals about the oldest forms of life. Finally, after a century of fractious effort, that story is coming into view.</p><p><div class="inline-media inline-image">

    </a></div></p><p>That means we are approaching one of the great divides in human history: the divide between those who know the story of life's beginning, and those who never could.</p><blockquote><p> Some of the people alive today will become the first in history who can honestly say they know where they came from </p></blockquote><p>Every single person who died before Darwin published <em>Origin of Species</em> in 1859 was ignorant of humanity's origins, because they knew nothing of evolution. But everyone alive now, barring isolated groups, can know the truth about our kinship with other animals.</p><p>Similarly, everyone born after Yuri Gagarin orbited the Earth in 1961 has lived in a society that can travel to other worlds. Even if we never go ourselves, space travel is a reality.</p><p>These facts change our worldview in subtle ways. Arguably, they make us wiser. Evolution teaches us to treasure every other living thing, for they are our cousins. Space travel allows us <a href="http://www.bbc.com/earth/story/20151109-take-a-trip-around-the-pale-blue-dot-we-all-call-home">to see our world from a distance</a>, revealing how unique and fragile it is.</p><p>Some of the people alive today will become the first in history who can honestly say they know where they came from. They will know what their ultimate ancestor was like and where it lived.</p><p>This knowledge will change us. On a purely scientific level, it will tell us about how likely life is to form in the Universe, and where to look for it. And it will tell us something about life's essential nature. But beyond that, we cannot yet know the wisdom the origin of life will reveal.</p><p><em>Join over five million BBC Earth fans by liking us on <a href="https://www.facebook.com/bbcearth" target="_blank">Facebook</a>, or follow us on <a href="https://twitter.com/bbcearth" target="_blank">Twitter</a> and <a href="https://instagram.com/bbcearth/" target="_blank">Instagram</a>.</em></p><p><em>If you liked this story, <a href="http://pages.emails.bbc.com/subscribe/?ocid=ear.bbc.email.we.email-signup" target="_blank">sign up for the weekly bbc.com features newsletter</a> called "If You Only Read 6 Things This Week".
