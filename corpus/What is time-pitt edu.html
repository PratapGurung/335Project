        Challenge</a>," underway at the time I write these words for the best      answer to the question "What is time?" The target audience is eleven year      old children and children of this age will be the ultimate judges. <a href="Flame_Challenge.pdf"><span          style="font-size: 75%;">(pdf
          of screen, December 23, 2012)</span></a>.</p>    <p class="level2">In one sense, the competition will be a great success. It      will be an occasion for many scientists--the only people allowed to      answer--to write some engaging prose related to time or to produce some      entertaining graphics on time. There will be some wonderful entries.</p>    <p class="level2">The challenge is introduced with a perfunctory and      familiar disclaimer. First comes a celebrated quote from Augustine</p>    <p class="level3">“What then is time? If no one asks me, I know what it is.      If I wish to explain it to him who asks, I do not know.”<br />      – Saint Augustine</p>    <p class="level2">The sentence that follows arrives with reliability that      night follows day follows night and was offered, I expect, without      reflection. Doesn't everyone know that...</p>    <p class="level3"><span style="font-style: italic; font-size: 120%;">It’s a        deep question, and it has no simple answer.</span></p>    <p class="level2">Is that really so?</p>    <p class="level2"><img src="esc_2.jpg" alt="escapement" width="455" /><br />      <span style="font-size: 60%;">clock escapements</span></p>    <h2 class="head-level1">The Question</h2>    <p class="level2">What is time?</p>    <p class="level2">There will be many delightful responses to the challenge.      However, I am confident to predict, none of them will answer the question      properly. (See <a href="#winning">below</a> for an update.) The most      successful entries will treat the question merely as an excuse to write or      display an answer to some other question. They will treat "What is time?"      as an open ended prompt. It will be for them the scientific equivalent of      "So, tell me, how are things?" It will be an exercise in creative      misdirection.</p>    <p class="level2">Why am I so confident? The reason is that the question      "What is time?" as asked is not really a scientific question at all.</p>    <p class="level2">The question is readily confused with other eminently      scientific questions, each of great interest. They include questions like:</p>    <p class="level3">Does time have a beginning?<br />      Does time have an end?<br />      If our molecular microphysics does not distinguish future from past, why      does ordinary, macroscopic physics? <br />      How do our notions of time change when we accommodate them to special      relativity? To general relativity? To quantum theory? </p>    <p class="level2">These questions and many more like them will be answered      in the best responses to the challenge.</p>    <p class="level2">What about "What is time?" ?</p>    <p class="level2">Now I can come to the real point of my piece. People      outside philosophy of science often wonder just what philosophers of      science do. Where does the work of the scientist end and that of the      philosopher of science begin? This question on time provides an      illustration.</p>    <p class="level2"><img src="esc_3.jpg" alt="escapement" width="455" /><br />      <span style="font-size: 60%;">clock escapements</span></p>    <h2 class="head-level1"> Struggling to Answer</h2>    <p class="level2">Scientists trying to answer this question will almost      invariably start by trying to deflect the question. If you ask them the      question, you may first get the rather superficial quips:</p>    <p class="level3">"Time is what clocks measure." </p>    <p class="level3">"Time is what stops everything happening all at once."</p>    <p class="level2">They are not real answers, but merely amusing retorts that      often serve to quieten an annoying questioner.</p>    <p class="level2">A more serious attempt to answer will tell you not what      time is but about some interesting temporal phenomenon.</p>    <p class="level2">In his special theory of relativity, Einstein showed that      different observers can disagree on which of two events happened first and      that can happen with neither being wrong. Or in his general theory of      relativity, we learn that space and time together have a geometry and that      its curvature is gravity. Or we learn from thermal physics that time      increases with a thermodynamic quantity, entropy, under the guidance of      the Second Law.</p>    <p class="level2">This may satisfy you. Or you might press harder and      complain that these responses only report some facts about time. But they      do not say what time IS. <em>What IS time?</em> you insist.</p>    <p class="level2"><span class="maintext">This display of stubbornness will        likely be met with awkwardness. The conversation may end with a cough or        another deflection. The answering scientists will be able to proceed        only if they adopt a different style of analysis. That is, they will        need to approach the question "What is time?" like a philosopher.</span></p>    <p class="level3"><span style="font-size: 80%;">How bad can the deflections        and evasions be? Look at <a href="http://www.forbes.com/2008/02/28/what-is-time-oped-time08-cx_ee_0229thought.html">          "What Is Time? In their Own Words: 14 Experts on Time.</a>" Or, if the        link doesn't work, look <a href="index2.html">here</a>.<br />      </span></p>    <p class="level2"><img src="esc_4.jpg" alt="escapement" width="455" /><br />      <span style="font-size: 60%;">clock escapements</span></p>    <h2 class="head-level1">Asking "What is...?"</h2>    <p class="level2">How do philosophers approach this question? Or at least      how do philosophers of science of my stripe do it? They are much less      confused by the question. They see that the core difficulty is that "What      is time?" is itself a bogus question or, to use the more technical term      beloved by philosophers, it is a pseudo-question.</p>    <p class="level3"><span style="font-size: 80%;">This way of thinking about        the question has a venerable pedigree. See Friedrich Waismann,        "Analytic-Synthetic II, <em>Analysis</em>, <strong>11</strong>,        (1950), pp. 25-38, on pp. 26-27.</span></p>    <p class="level2"> The grammatical form of the question makes it look like      other simple questions such as:</p>    <p class="level3">"What is the Atlantic Ocean?"<br />      "What are submarines?"<br />      "What are stars?"<br />      "What is the Leidenfrost effect?"</p>    <p class="level2">All these questions admit straightforward answers: a      certain body of water; a boat that goes underwater; very hot balls of gas;      what happens when a water drop is suspended above a very hot plate by a      layer of vapor.</p>    <p class="level2">The question "What is time?" has no corresponding answer.      The "IS" question demands that we identify time with something else      typically but not necessarily better known to us, much as we identify      submarines with boats that go underwater. The very asking of the question      in this illicit form is what makes time mysterious.</p>    <p class="level2">To proceed, we need to separate two ways that this "IS"      question can be asked.</p>    <p class="level2"><img src="esc_5.jpg" alt="escapement" width="455" /><br />      <span style="font-size: 60%;">clock escapements</span></p>    <h2 class="head-level1">"What is...?" as a demand for familiar substitution.</h2>    <p class="level2">This is the every-day form of the question and one that      was likely originally intended for time. It is a request for a      substitution by other notions already familiar in the same discourse.</p>    <p class="level2">We might ask "What is a ketch?" The answer is that it is a      two-masted sailboat, rigged fore-aft with triangular sails, with the      smaller mast aft.</p>    <p class="level2">What is distinctive in the response is that each of the      notions employed in the answer are presumed already known to the      questioner.</p>    <p class="level2">When the question "What is time?" is asked in this mode,      the exercise degenerates into a circular word game. There is no answer in      our ordinary vocabulary that does not already have the notion of time in      it.</p>    <p class="level2">The simplest way to see this is to consult a dictionary      for a definition of time. For example, you will find:</p>    <p class="level3">"the system of those sequential relations that any event      has to any other, as past, present, or future;..."<br />      (dictionary.com)</p>    <p class="level2">This is about as good as a definition as you can get.      However the circularity is quite evident the moment you ask just: just      what is an event, as opposed, to a thing. Or what is past, present and      future, as opposed to left, center and right?</p>    <p class="level2">No answer is possible unless we use sentences that employ      the word "time." Or, at best, we use sentences with another synonym for      time that merely postpones the manifestation of the circularity.</p>    <p class="level2">The quips listed above do no better at avoiding the      circularity.</p>    <p class="level3">"Time is what clocks measure."<br />      What is a clock as opposed to a teapot?</p>    <p class="level3">"Time is what stops everything happening all at once."<br />      What is it to happen? How does "at once" modify it?</p>    <p class="level2">It takes only a little playing of this game to realize      that breaking out of the circularity is impossible. We have reached a kind      of linguistic bedrock with the term "time" such that we cannot go deeper.</p>    <p class="level2">This troublesome circularity is the basis of Augustine'      lament above; or at least it is the reason that the lament can continue in      our repertoire of purportedly deep truths.</p>    <p class="level2"><img src="esc_6.jpg" alt="escapement" width="455" /><br />      <span style="font-size: 60%;">clock escapements</span></p>    <h2 class="head-level1">We cannot answer. So What?</h2>    <p class="level2">What does this failure mean? Does it mean that this      innocent question has pressed us to confront a dark and shameful chasm in      our knowledge?</p>    <p class="level2">Hardly. </p>    <p class="level2">Average eleven year olds have a pretty firm grasp of      temporal phenomena. They understand quite well how today differs from      tomorrow and yesterday; that an hour is much longer than a minute; how to      use a clock to coordinate a meeting with a friend at 11am sharp; and much      more. Our ordinary knowledge of time resides in a huge collection of banal      facts of this form. There is no mystery in them. There is just the      banality of ordinary temporal life.</p>    <p class="level2">The mystery only comes when we demand that someone say      what time IS. We are suddenly to imagine a something, somewhere that      somehow is responsible for everything temporal, much as our imaginations      form images of the wild beast in the tower responsible for the terrible      howls at night.</p>    <p class="level2">The mystery is created by a hidden presumption in the      question. Our familiar repository of ordinary temporal facts somehow fails      us, we are supposed to think. It is not telling us what time IS. There is      something more that has not been said that needs to be said, we find      ourselves thinking.</p>    <p class="level2">But there is nothing more. There is nothing extra needed.      We understand time perfectly well already.</p>    <p class="level2">It is curious that we allow the question to stand. The      question demands an answer when no answer can be given. We have heard      these questions before and know how to deal with them. They are impossible      to answer since they have presumptions buried in them that preclude      answers. We dismiss them as frivolous word games and do not, or should      not, mistake their impossibility as resting on some deep truth or hidden      wisdom.</p>    <p class="level3">What happens when an irresistible force meets an immovable      object?</p>    <p class="level3">The collision can never happen since you cannot have both      this force and this object. If you have one then the other is impossible.      The trick is to get you to accept that both are simultaneously possible.</p>    <p class="level3">What is the sound of one hand clapping?</p>    <p class="level3">The trick presumption is that there is a sound, whereas we      know that one hand cannot clap by itself.</p>    <p class="level3">Just where is cyberspace?</p>    <p class="level3">The trick presumption is that we must supply a geographic      location like "At the intersection of Bigelow and Fifth Avenue" or "on      Brunot's Island."</p>    <p class="level2"><img src="esc_7.jpg" alt="escapement" width="455" /><br />      <span style="font-size: 60%;">clock escapements</span></p>    <h2 class="head-level1">What is... as a request for explication from new      theory.</h2>    <p class="level2">There is a second way this question might be asked. It is      a request for new knowledge that goes beyond what we already know,      typically in the form of a new physical theory.</p>    <p class="level3">What is a cloud?</p>    <p class="level3">...Tiny droplets of water that scatter light.</p>    <p class="level3">What is air?</p>    <p class="level3">...A mixture of roughly four parts nitrogen gas, one part      oxygen gas and a some other gases in lesser amounts.</p>    <p class="level3">What is light?</p>    <p class="level3">...The propagation of a wave-like disturbance in the      electromagnetic field; and the energy of the disturbance may be partially      localized spatially in quanta or photons.</p>    <p class="level2">Each of these answers calls up new notions of successively      greater scientific sophistication. The question "What is time?" may be      answered in this mode as well. There is a naive expectation that the fancy      theories of modern physics somehow do a better job of answering the      question without the circularity of the familiar substitutions just      sketched.</p>    <p class="level2"><img src="esc_1.jpg" alt="escapement" width="455" /><br />      <span style="font-size: 60%;">clock escapements</span></p>    <h2 class="head-level1">The Circularity Remains</h2>    <p class="level2"> Do these new theories do any better with the original      circularity?</p>    <p class="level2">They do not. However the failure is harder to see since      the fancier theories surround familiar notions in a fog of novel      terminology and conceptions.</p>    <p class="level2">Perhaps we might be assured that time is really just one      of the dimensions of a four dimensional spacetime manifold. Or that all      that really exists are events or processes and time arises from how they      are arranged. Or that there are <a href="../../teaching/HPS_0410/chapters/significance/index.html#L5295">causal
        orderings</a> of things and time flows along them.</p>    <p class="level2">These proposals and many more like them are erudite and      impressive. If they are correct, we are certainly learning something new      about time.</p>    <p class="level2">But we are doing no better than we did with the original      circularity. A four-dimensional manifold is just a set whose elements can      be continuously labeled by four numbers. What makes some candidate      four-dimensional manifold a spacetime manifold as opposed merely to some      four-dimensional space with no association with time?</p>    <p class="level2">We can only identify it as a spacetime if we know how to      connect the manifold in the right way to things in the world so that one      dimension has a temporal character. But doing that already requires that      we know what is temporal. The circularity has returned.</p>    <p class="level2"><img src="esc_3.jpg" alt="escapement" width="455" /><br />      <span style="font-size: 60%;">clock escapements</span></p>    <h2 class="head-level1">What do philosophers do?</h2>    <p class="level2">We return to the competition. The challenge is      well-conceived precisely because the question admits no appropriate      answer. It must be answered by creative diversions, none of which can be      judged unequivocally to be the complete and correct answer. It will be      intriguing and entertaining to see just what the scientists can offer.</p>    <p class="level2">There will be plenty of good science and plenty of good      pedagogy in the responses.</p>    <p class="level2">While there will be good science, the challenge will      perpetuate bad philosophy. It will reinforce the idea that deep      foundational thinking--the proper domain of philosophical      analysis--resides in posing questions that we find so awkward that we do      not answer but must evade them with clever ripostes or diversions.</p>    <p class="level2">Those who pay no attention to philosophical analysis will      find the question "What is time?" mysterious and challenging and will      struggle to understand just why it is so hard to provide a proper answer.      They may even lament that it is a deeply philosophical question, thereby      conveniently banishing it from those questions they feel a professional      obligation to answer.</p>    <p class="level2">Philosophers, or at least those like me, will have little      trouble in identifying the mystery and challenge as one that is cheaply      gained. We are asked a pseudo-question that is so laden with hidden      presumption that no direct answer is possible.</p>    <p class="level2">Bad philosophy of science takes confusing questions and      fails to answer them clearly. It misdiagnoses the failure as a symptom of      the great philosophical depth of the question.</p>    <p class="level2">Good philosophy of science takes the same confusing      questions and talks through them until the mystery is gone and one wonders      why anyone was ever confused by them in the first place.</p>    <p class="level3" style="font-size: 80%;" id="winning">I set aside the      tiresome traditions in philosophy that try to argue that time is unreal,      an illusion or perhaps some byproduct of how we connect with the true,      timeless but mysteriously elusive reality. These traditions are mere      cleverness, untempered by common sense. They show that even smart      philosophers are as capable as any myth maker of losing themselves in      fantasy worlds of their own creation.</p>    <hr width="50%" />    <p class="level2"><span style="font-size: 90%;">(Added February 14, 2018)</span></p>    <p class="level2">The winning video and the winning text entries have been      posted at <a href="https://www.aldacenter.org/flame-challenge-what-time">https://www.aldacenter.org/flame-challenge-what-time</a></p>    <p class="level2">The primary substance of the video is the idea that space      and time together form a four-dimensional entity, spacetime, and that time      is one of its coordinates. It differs from the other coordinates in that      we cannot move freely in it. There is also some irrelevant, goofy humor      designed to appeal to eleven year olds. I would like to think the eleven      year old judges found the goofiness insulting, but I fear they did not.</p>    <p class="level2">The winning text entry reads:</p>    <p class="level3" style="background-color: AliceBlue">What is time?<br />      <br />      Have you ever heard your parents say to you that it’s time to go to bed or      time to get up, time to go to school, time to clean your room, time to do      this, time to do that, and on and on. Our world runs on a time schedule,      and the schedule is so tight that there are schedules for everything we do      throughout the day and clocks that tell you what time it is so we can do      those things at the correct time. Time is so obvious in our lives that no      one questions it. It’s just there, we have to live with it, and so we      accept it. All activity on earth is based on time, and this time is what      happened a second ago, a minute ago, an hour ago, days ago, and years ago.      Well, now we have an important question. What is it?<br />      <br />      Time has a lot of definitions; like time is history or time is age. But,      have we ever considered a good definition? I have. Here’s my definition.      And no, I did not get this from some book or online. It’s just something      that makes sense to me. I think of time as Forward Movement. Think about      it! Everything moves forward, from the universe to every second of your      life. And because everything moves forward, man developed a way to keep      track of this Forward Movement and called it time. Man also invented      clocks to keep a precise log of this Forward Movement in years, days,      hours, minutes, seconds, and even parts of seconds. I’ll always continue      to think of time as Forward Motion. I’ll also think of it as a Forward      Motion that will never change, will never stop, and can never be reversed.</p>    <p class="level2">The original circularity of Augustine's question remains.      What is movement or motion? Is movement just change in time? How can it be      explained to someone who does not already know what time is? </p>    <p class="level2">Overall I am quite disappointed with the winning entries.      They are distinguished not by any creative pedagogic flair, but by their      banality. Merely reporting some easy facts about time is far from      answering the question posed, "What is time?" It is sobering that these      were the winning entries. What did the others say?
